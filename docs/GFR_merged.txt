purchases should be made in a
transparent, competitive and fair manner,
to secure best value for money. This will
also enable the prospective bidders to
formulate and send their competitive bids
with confidence. Some of the measures for
ensuring the above are as follows:(i)
the text of the bidding document
should be self-contained and
comprehensive without any
ambiguities. All essential
information, which a bidder needs
for sending responsive bid, should
be clearly spelt out in the bidding
document in simple language. The
condition of prior turnover and prior
experience may be relaxed for
Startups (as defined by Department
of Industrial Policy and Promotion)
subject to meeting of quality &
technical specifications and making
suitable provisions in the bidding
document. The bidding document
should contain, inter alia.
(a) Description and Specifications
of goods including the nature,
quantity, time and place or
places of delivery.
(b) the criteria for eligibility and
qualifications to be met by the
bidders such as minimum level
of experience, past
performance, technical
capability, manufacturing
facilities and financial position
etc or limitation for
participation of the bidders, if
any.
(c) eligibility criteria for goods
indicating any legal restrictions
or conditions about the origin of
goods etc which may required
to be met by the successful
bidder.
(d) the procedure as well as date,
time and place for sending the
bids.
(e) date, time and place of
opening of the bid.
(e) Criteria for evaluation of bids
(f) s p e c i a l t e r m s a f f e c t i n g
performance, if any.
(g) E s s e n t i a l t e r m s o f t h e
procurement contract

contractual obligations of the supplier
including warranty obligations.
(iii) Bid security should be refunded to the
successful bidder on receipt of
Performance Security.
(1) Advance payment to supplier
Ordinarily, payments for services rendered
or supplies made should be released only
after the services have been rendered or
supplies made. However, it may become
necessary to make advance payments for
example in the following types of cases :(i) Advance payment demanded by firms
holding maintenance contracts for
servicing of Air- conditioners,
computers, other costly equipment,
etc.
(ii) Advance payment demanded by firms
against fabrication contracts, turn-key
contracts etc.
Such advance payments should not
exceed the following limits :
(a) Thirty per cent. of the contract
value to private firms;
(b) Forty per cent. of the contract
value to a State
or Central
Government agency or a Public
Sector Undertaking; or
(c) in case of maintenance contract,
the amount should not exceed the
amount payable for six months
under the contract.
Ministries or Departments of the
Central Government may relax,
in consultation with their
Financial Advisers concerned, the
ceilings (including percentage
laid down for advance payment
for private firms) mentioned
above. While making any
advance payment as above,
adequate safeguards in the form
of bank guarantee etc. should be
obtained from the firm.
(2) Part payment to suppliers:
Depending on the terms of delivery
incorporated in a contract, part payment
to the supplier may be released after it
dispatches the goods from its premises in
terms of the contract.

where quality of consultancy is of prime
concern.
(i) In QCBS initially the quality of
technical proposals is scored as per
criteria announced in the RFP. Only
those responsive proposals that have
achieved at least minimum specified
qualifying score in quality of technical
proposal are considered further.
(ii) After opening and scoring, the
Financial proposals of responsive
technically qualified bidders, a final
combined score is arrived at by giving
predefined relative weight ages for the
score of quality of the technical
proposal and the score of financial
proposal.
(iii) The RFP shall specify the minimum
qualifying score for the quality of
technical proposal and also the
relative weight ages to be given to the
quality and cost (determined for each
case depending on the relative
importance of quality vis-a-vis cost
aspects in the assignment, e.g. 70:30,

for Technical score in the final evaluation
and the responsive technically qualified
proposal with the lowest evaluated cost
shall be selected.
Single Source Selection/Consultancy

the competent authority obtained
before resorting to such single-source
selection.
(v) It shall ensure fairness and equity, and
shall have a procedure in place to
ensure that the prices are reasonable
and consistent with market rates for
tasks of a similar nature; and the
required consultancy services are not
split into smaller sized procurement.
Monitoring the Contract. The
Ministry/Department should be involved
throughout in the conduct of consultancy,
preferably by taking a task force approach
and continuously monitoring the
performance of the consultant(s) so that
the output of the consultancy is in line with
the Ministry /Department’s objectives.
Public competition for Design of

Manual for Procurement
of
Goods
(Updated June, 2022)

FOREWORD
1.

Government organizations procure a wide variety of goods and services and undertake
execution of works in pursuance of their duties and responsibilities. With a view to
improving transparency in decision making in public procurement and reducing the
scope for subjectivity, Department of Expenditure in 2006 had prepared a set of three
Manuals on Policies and Procedures for Procurement of Goods, Works and hiring of
Consultants, in conformity with the General Financial Rules (GFR), 2005. Over the years,
these Manuals have served as a guide book for procurement.

2.

In the last few years, the Government of India has issued new instructions in the domain
of public procurement. Some of these important changes include introduction of Central
Public Procurement Portal (CPPP), Government e-Marketplace (GeM), preferential market
access for micro and small enterprises, preference for domestic manufacturers of electronic
goods, inclusion of integrity pact, etc. The GFR has been revised comprehensively in
March 2017 covering inter-alia these set of new instructions. Consequently the Manual
of Procurement too has been revised after a decade and within a month of the release
of GFR 2017.

3.

The new Manual on Procurement of Goods has been extensively revised in keeping with
GFR 2017 and in consonance with the fundamental principles of transparency, fairness,
competition, economy, efficiency and accountability. Efforts have been made to cover
all major aspects of procurement in this Manual in a user-friendly manner. The manual is
the outcome of extensive consultations in two stages with Ministries/Departments/PSUs
and other organizations over a period of six months.

4.

Manuals issued by this Department are to be taken as generic guidelines, which have
to be necessarily broad in nature. Ministries/Departments are advised to supplement
this manual to suit their local/specialized needs, by issuing their own detailed
manuals (including customized formats); Standard Bidding Documents and Schedule of
Procurement Powers to serve as detailed instructions for their own procuring officers.

5.

I would like to acknowledge the lead taken by Dr. Vivek Joshi, Joint Secretary, DoE and
dedicated efforts of Shri Sanjay Aggarwal, Director (PPD), Shri Vinayak T. Likhar, Under
Secretary(PPD) and Shri Girish Bhatnagar, Consultant (Public Procurement) in revision of
this Manual. I would also like to thank Ministries, Departments, other organisations and
individuals who reviewed the drafts of the Manual and provided their valuable inputs.

6.

I hope that this Manual would be useful to procuring officials working in various Ministries/
Departments as operating instructions and will bring about greater transparency and
predictability in government procedures and help in improving the ease of doing Business
with Government.

(Ashok Lavasa)
Finance Secretary

Chapter 1: Introduction – Policies and Principles
1.1

Procurement Rules and Regulations; and this Manual

Various Ministries, Departments, attached and subordinate offices, local urban bodies, public
sector enterprises and other Government (including autonomous) bodies (hereinafter
referred as ‘Procuring Entities’) spend a sizeable amount of their budget on procurement of
goods, works and services to discharge the duties and responsibilities assigned to them.
The Ministries / Departments have been delegated full powers to make their own
arrangements for procurement of goods and services, that are not available6 on Government
e-Marketplace (GeM). These powers have to be exercised which have to be exercised as
per the Delegation of Financial Power Rules and in conformity with the ‘Procurement
Guidelines’ described below. Common use Goods and Services available on GeM are
required to be procured mandatorily through GeM as per Rule 149 of GFR, 2017
To ensure that these procurements are made by following a uniform, systematic, efficient
and cost-effective procedure and also to ensure fair and equitable treatment of suppliers,
there are statutory provisions, rules, financial, vigilance, security, safety, counter- trade and
other regulations; orders and guidelines of the Government on the subject of public
procurement (hereinafter referred as ‘Procurement Guidelines’) which provide framework for
the public procurement system.
At the apex of the Statutory framework governing public procurement is Article 299 of the
Constitution of India, which stipulates that contracts legally binding on the Government have
to be executed in writing by officers specifically authorized to do so. The Constitution also
enshrines Fundamental Rights (In particular Article 19 (1) (g) – Right to carry on a
Profession) which have implications for Public Procurement. Further, the Indian Contract
Act, 1872 and the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 are major legislations governing contracts of
sale/ purchase of goods in general. There are other mercantile laws (Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996;Competition Act, 2002; Information Technology Act, 2000 etc), which
may be attracted in Public Procurement Transactions. There is no law exclusively governing
public procurement.
However, comprehensive Rules and Regulations in this regard are available in the General
Financial Rules (GFR), 2017, especially chapter 6; Delegation of Financial Powers Rules
(DFPR); Government orders regarding product reservations or purchase preference or other
facilities to sellers in Micro and Small Enterprises, Pharmaceutical Central Public Sector
Enterprises, Khadi/ Handlooms goods goods, works and services rendered with more than
prescribed local content (Make in India) etc.
Without purporting to be a comprehensive compendium of all such ‘Procurement
Guidelines’, this Manual is intended to serve as a portal to enter this vast area and draw
attention to basic norms and practices governing public procurement.

For revision, interpretation, clarification and issues relating to this manual, the Procurement
Policy Division, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance would be the nodal authority.

1.3

Applicability of this Manual

The term 'goods' used in this manual includes all articles, material, commodity, livestock,
medicines, furniture, fixtures, raw material, consumables, spare parts, instruments,
machinery, equipment, industrial plants, vehicles, aircraft, ships, railway rolling stock,
assemblies, sub-assemblies, accessories, a group of machines comprising an integrated
production process or such other goods (but excludes books, publications, periodicals, and
so on, for a library), or intangible products like software, technology transfer, licenses,
patents or other intellectual properties procured or otherwise acquired by a procuring entity.
Procurement of goods may include certain small work or some services, which are incidental
or consequential to the supply of such goods, such as transportation, insurance, installation,
commissioning, training and maintenance (Rule 143 of GFR 2017). What is unique about
procurement of goods (as compared to services and works) is the ability to precisely
describe the technical specification of the requirement.
The ‘Procurement Entities’ who can benefit from this manual include Ministries,
Departments, or a unit thereof, or an attached or subordinate offices/units; Central Public
Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) or undertakings; any other body (including autonomous bodies)
substantially owned or controlled by or receiving substantial financial assistance from the
Central Government. These procurement guidelines would continue to apply if these
procurement entities outsource the procurement process or bundle the procurement process
with other contractual arrangements or utilise the services of procurement support agency or
procurement agents to carry out the procurement on their behalf. But these procurement
guidelines would not apply to procurements by these procuring entities for their own use (but
not for purpose of trading/ sale) from their subsidiary companies including Joint Ventures in
which they have controlling share.
However by a general or special notification, the Government may permit certain ‘Procuring
Entities’ mentioned in sub-para above, considering unique conditions under which they
operate, for all or certain categories of procurement, to adopt detailed approved guidelines
for procurement, which may deviate in some aspects but conform with all other essential
aspects of ‘Procurement Guidelines’.
This Manual is to be taken as generic guidelines, which have to be necessarily broad in
nature. Subject to the observance of these generic guidelines, the initiation, authorization,
procurement and execution of Goods Contracts undertaken by a particular Ministry or
Department shall be regulated by detailed rules and orders contained in the respective
Departmental regulations and by other special orders applicable to them. Ministries/
Departments are advised to supplement these manuals to suit their local/ specialized needs,
by issuing their own detailed Manuals (including customized formats); Standard Bidding
Documents; Schedule of Procurement Powers 7 and Checklists to serve as practical
instructions for their officers and to ensure completeness of examination of cases. Major
Goods procuring Ministries/Departments like the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Railways,

7

Notified vide OM No.F.1/36/2018-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 28.12.2018

2

etc. have their own detailed guidelines tailored to unique individual requirements, e.g.
Manuals or Procedure Orders. Many other Ministries/ Departments as well as CPSEs also
have their own Procurement Manuals. For these Procuring Entities, this Manual would serve
as a generic reference.
These guidelines would not be applicable to projects funded by World Bank and other
International Funding Agencies, as, such external aid/ loans etc. received are covered under
the applicable policies/ legal agreements executed as permitted under Rules 264 of GFR
2017.
For procurements financed by Loans/Grants extended by International Agencies: The
Articles of Agreement with the International Agencies, like the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank etc. stipulate specific procurement procedures to be followed by the
borrowers. The procurement procedures, as finalized and incorporated in the Agreements
after consideration and approval of the Ministry of Finance are to be followed accordingly.

1.4

Authorities competent to purchase goods and their Purchase Powers

1.4.1 A Competent authority which is competent to incur expenditure may sanction the
purchase of goods required for use in public service in accordance with the Delegation of
Financial Rules (DFPR – extracted in Annexure 2A) by following the ‘Procurement
Guidelines’ described in this Manual (Rule 145 of GFR 2017) .Each ‘Procuring Entity’ may
issue a Schedule of Procurement Powers (SoPP) adding further details to the broad
delegations in the DFPR, based on the assessment of risks involved in different decisions/
approvals at various stages of Procurement Cycle. A suggested structure of such SoPP is
enclosed as Annexure 2C.

1.5

Basic Aims of Procurement – the Five R’s of Procurement

In every procurement, public or private, the basic aim is to achieve just the right balance
between costs and requirements concerning the following five parameters called the Five
R’s of procurement. The entire process of procurement (from the time the need for an item,
facility or services is identified till the need is satisfied) is designed to achieve such a right
balance. The word ‘right’ is used in the sense of ‘optimal balance’.
i)

Right Quality

Procurement aims to buy just the right quality that will suit the needs – no more and no less
– with clear specification of the procuring entity’s requirements, proper understanding of
functional value and cost, understanding of the bidder’s quality system and quality
awareness. The concept of the right balance of quality can be further refined to the concept
of utility/value (Please refer to para 1.6 below). For the Right Quality, Technical Specification
is the most vital ingredient. In public procurement, it is essential to give due consideration to
Value for Money while benchmarking the specification.
ii)

Right Quantity

There are extra costs and systemic overheads involved with both procuring a requirement
too frequently in small quantities or with buying large quantities for prolonged use. Hence,
the right quantity should be procured (in appropriate size of contract) which balances extra
costs associated with larger and smaller quantities.
iii)

Right Price

3

It is not correct to aim at the cheapest materials/ facilities/ Services available. The price
should be just right for the quality, quantity and other factors involved (or should not be
abnormally low for a facilities/works/ services which could lead to a situation of nonperformance or failure of contract). The concept of price can be refined further to take into
account not only the initial price paid for the requirement but also other costs such as
maintenance costs, operational costs and disposal costs (Also termed as life cycle costing please also refer to para 1.6 below)
iv)

Right Time and Place

If the material (or facility or services) is needed by an organisation in three months’ time, it
will be costly to procure it too late or too early. Similarly, if the vendor delivers the materials/
facilities/ services in another city, extra time and money would be involved in logistics. An
unrealistic time schedule for completion of a facility may lead to delays, claims and disputes.
v)

Right Source

Similarly, the source of delivery of Goods, Works and Services of the requirement must have
just right financial capacity and technical capability for our needs (demonstrated through
satisfactory past performance of contracts of same or similar nature). Buying a few packets
of printer paper directly from a large manufacturer may not be the right strategy. On the
other hand, if our requirements are very large, buying such requirements through dealers or
middlemen may also not be right.

1.6

Refined Concepts of Cost and Value – Value for Money

The concept of price or cost has been further refined into Total Cost Of Ownership (TCO) or
Life Cycle Cost (LCC) or Whole-of-Life (WOL) to take into account not only the initial
acquisition cost but also cost of operation, maintenance and disposal during the lifetime of
the external resource procured. Similarly, the concept of quality is linked to the need and is
refined into the concept of utility/ value. These two, taken together, are used to develop the
concept of Value for Money (VfM, also called Best Value for Money in certain contexts). VfM
means the effective, efficient, and economic use of resources, which may involve the
evaluation of relevant costs and benefits, along with an assessment of risks, non-price
attributes (e.g. in goods and/or services that contain recyclable content, are recyclable,
minimise waste and greenhouse gas emissions, conserve energy and water and minimize
habitat destruction and environmental degradation, are non-toxic etc.) and/or life cycle costs,
as appropriate. Price alone may not necessarily represent VfM. In public procurement, VfM
is achieved by attracting the widest competition by way of optimal description of need;
development of value-engineered specifications/ Terms of Reference (ToR); appropriate
packaging/ slicing of requirement; selection of an appropriate mode of procurement and
bidding system. These advanced concepts are explained in Appendix 1.

1.7

Fundamental Principles of Public Procurement

General Financial Rules, 2017 (Rule 144) lay down the Fundamental Principles of Public
Procurement. These principles and other additional obligations of procuring authorities in
public procurement can be organised into five fundamental principles of public procurement,
which all procuring authorities must abide by and be accountable for:
i)

Transparency Principle

4

All procuring authorities are responsible and accountable to ensure transparency, fairness,
equality, competition and appeal rights. This involves simultaneous, symmetric and
unrestricted dissemination of information to all likely bidders, sufficient for them to know and
understand the availability of bidding opportunities and actual means, processes and timelimits prescribed for completion of registration of bidders, bidding, evaluation, grievance
redressal, award and management of contracts. It implies that such officers must ensure that
there is consistency (absence of subjectivity), predictability (absence of arbitrariness), clarity,
openness (absence of secretiveness), equal opportunities (absence of discrimination) in
processes. In essence Transparency Principle also enjoins upon the Procuring Authorities’
to do only that which it had professed to do as pre-declared in the relevant published
documents and not to do anything that had not been so declared’. As part of this principle, all
procuring entities should ensure that offers should be invited following a fair and transparent
procedure and also ensure publication of all relevant information on the Central Public
Procurement Portal (CPPP).
ii)

Professionalism Principle

As per these synergic attributes, the procuring authorities have a responsibility and
accountability to ensure professionalism, economy, efficiency, effectiveness and integrity in
the procurement process. They must avoid wasteful, dilatory and improper practices
violating the Code of integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP) mentioned in Chapter 3 of this
manual. They should, at the same time, ensure that the methodology adopted for
procurement should not only be reasonable and appropriate for the cost and complexity but
should also effectively achieve the planned objective of the procurement. As part of this
principle, the Government may prescribe professional standards and specify suitable training
and certification requirements for officials dealing with procurement matters.
In reference to the above two principles - Transparency and Professionalism Principle, It
may be useful to refer to the following provisions in the General Financial Rules, 2017:
Rule 144. Fundamental principles of public buying: Fundamental principles of public buying
(for all procurements including procurement of works).— Every authority delegated with the
financial powers of procuring goods in public interest shall have the responsibility and
accountability to bring efficiency, economy, and transparency in matters relating to public
procurement and for fair and equitable treatment of suppliers and promotion of competition
in public procurement.
The procedure to be followed in making public procurement must conform to the following
yardsticks:a) The description of the subject matter of procurement to the extent practicable
should -1. be objective, functional, generic and measurable and specify
technical, qualitative and performance characteristics;
2. not indicate a requirement for a particular trade mark, trade name or
brand.
b) the specifications in terms of quality, type etc., as also quantity of goods to be
procured, should be clearly spelt out keeping in view the specific needs of the
procuring organisations. The specifications so worked out should meet the basic

5

needs of the organisation without including superfluous and non-essential
features, which may result in unwarranted expenditure.
c) Where applicable, the technical specifications shall, to the extent practicable,
be based on the national technical regulations or recognized national standards
or building codes, wherever such standards exist, and in their absence, be based
on the relevant international standards. In case of Government of India funded
projects abroad, the technical specifications may be framed based on
requirements and standards of the host beneficiary Government, where such
standards exist. Provided that a procuring entity may, for reasons to be recorded
in writing, adopt any other technical specification8.
d) Care should also be taken to avoid purchasing quantities in excess of
requirement to avoid inventory carrying costs;
e) offers should be invited following a fair, transparent and reasonable
procedure;
f) the procuring authority should be satisfied that the selected offer adequately
meets the requirement in all respects;
g) the procuring authority should satisfy itself that the price of the selected offer
is reasonable and consistent with the quality required;
h)
at each stage of procurement the concerned procuring authority must place
on record, in precise terms, the considerations which weighed with it while taking
the procurement decision.
i) a complete schedule of procurement cycle from date of issuing the tender to
date of issuing the contract should be published when the tender is issued.
j) All Ministries/Departments shall prepare Annual Procurement Plan before the
commencement of the year and the same should also be placed on the their
website”
k) [Notwithstanding anything contained in these Rules, Department of
Expenditure may, by order in writing, impose restrictions, including prior
registration and/or screening, on procurement from bidders from a country or
countries, or a class of countries, on grounds of defence of India, or matters
directly or indirectly related thereto including national security; no procurement
shall be made in violation of such restrictions.]9
iii)

Broader Obligations Principle

8

It has been reiterated by Department of Expenditure vide OM F.N.12/17/2019-PPD dated 12.05.2020 that
wherever Indian Technical specifications and Quality Certifications exists, the procuring entity should prescribe
them. In those rare or exceptional cases where, despite the existence of Indian technical specifications, the
procuring entity intends to specify foreign Technical Certifications and Accreditations, it must record its
reasons in writing for adoption of such other technical specifications. This may also be subject to matter of
audit.

6

Over and above transparency and professionalism, the procuring authorities have also the
responsibility and accountability to conduct public procurement in a manner to facilitate
achievement of the broader objectives of the Government - to the extent these are
specifically included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’:
a) Preferential procurement from backward regions, weaker sections and
MSEs, locally manufactured goods or services, to the extent specifically
included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’; and
b) Reservation of procurement of specified class of goods from or through
certain nominated CPSEs or Government Organisations, to the extent
specifically included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’.
c) Support to broader social policy and programme objectives of the
Government (for example, economic growth, strengthening of local industry make-in-India, Ease of Doing Business, job and employment creation, and so
on, to the extent specifically included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’);
d) Facilitating administrative goals of other Departments of Government (for
example, ensuring tax or environmental compliance by participants, Energy
Conservation, accessibility for People With Disabilities etc. to the extent
specifically included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’).
e) Procurement policies and procedures must comply with accessibility criteria
which may be mandated by the Government from time to time. Keeping this in
view, Department of Expenditure amended Rule 144 of GFR, 2017 and
introduced a sub-rule (xi) imposing restrictions under the rule [as mentioned
under (ii) above]. The detailed provisions were notified through Order (Public
Procurement No.1)10 which are as follows:

Maintenance Contract (AMC)/ Comprehensive Maintenance Contract (CMC),
including consumables for closed systems, from Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) or their authorized agents, shall be exempted from the requirement of
registration as mandated under Rule 144(xi) of GFR, 2017 and Public Procurement
orders issued in this regard16.
Clarification to Order (Public Procurement No.1) dated 23rd July 202017
For the purpose of (2)(b) above, “qualified bidders” means only those bidders would
otherwise have been qualified for award of the tender after considering all factors
including price, if the Order (Public Procurement No.1) dated 23rd July 2020 had not
been issued.
If bidders form such countries would not have qualified for award for reasons
unconnected with the said Orders (for example, because they do not meet tender
criteria or their price bid is higher or because of the provisions of purchase
preference under any other order or rule or any other reason) then there is no need
to scrap the tender/ start the process de novo.
The following examples are given to assist in implementation of the Order
1.
Example l: Four bids are received in a tender. One of them is from a country
which shares a land border with India. The bidder from such country is found
to be qualified technically by meeting all prescribed criteria and is also the
lowest bidder. In this case, the bidder is qualified for award of the tender,
except for the provisions of the Order (Public Procurement No. 1) dated 23rd
July. In this case, the tender should be scrapped and fresh tender initiated.
2.
Example 2: The facts are as in Example 1, but the bidder from such country,
though technically qualified is not the lowest because there are other
technically qualified bidders whose price is lower. Hence the bidder from such
country would not be qualified for award of the tender irrespective of the
Order (Public Procurement No. 1) dated 23rd July 2020. In such a case, there
is no need to scrap the tender.
3.
Example 3: The facts are as in Example 1, but the bidder from a country
which shares a land border with India, though technically qualified, is not
eligible for award due to the application of price preference as per other
orders/ rules. In such a case, there is no need to scrap the tender.
4.
Example 4: Three bids are received in a tender. One of them is a bidder from
a country sharing a land border with India. The bidder from such a country
does not meet the technical requirements and hence is not qualified. There is
no need to scrap the tender.

Procuring authorities must fulfil additional legal obligations in public procurement, over and
above mere conformity to the mercantile laws (which even private sector procurements have
to comply with). The Constitution of India has certain provisions regarding fundamental rights
and public procurement. Courts have, over a time, taking a broader view of Public
Procurement as a function of ‘State’, interpreted these to extend the responsibility and
accountability of public procurement Authorities. Courts in India thus exercise additional
judicial review (beyond contractual issues) over public procurement in relation to the manner
of decision making in respect of fundamental rights, fair play and legality. Similarly, procuring
authorities have also the responsibility and accountability to comply with the laws relating to
Governance Issues like Right to Information (RTI) Act and Prevention of Corruption Act, and
so on. Details of such extended legal obligations are given in Appendix 2.
v)

Public Accountability Principle

Procuring authorities are accountable for all the above principles to several statutory and
official bodies in the Country – the Legislature and its Committees, Central Vigilance
Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Central Bureau of Investigations and
so on– in addition to administrative accountability. As a result, each individual public
procurement transaction is liable to be scrutinised independently, in isolation, besides
judging the overall outcomes of procurement process over a period of time. Procuring
authorities thus have responsibility and accountability for compliance of rules and
procedures in each individual procurement transaction besides the achievement of overall
procurement outcomes. The procuring authority, at each stage of procurement, must
therefore place on record, in precise terms, the considerations which weighed with it while
making the procurement decision from need assessment to fulfilment of need. Such records
must be preserved, retained in easily retrievable form and made available to such oversight
agencies. The procuring entity shall therefore maintain and retain audit trails, records and
documents generated or received during its procurement proceedings, in chronological
order, the files will be stored in an identified place and retrievable for scrutiny whenever
needed without wastage of time. The documents and record will include:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)
g)

i)

1.8

documents pertaining to determination of need for procurement;
description of the subject matter of the procurement;
Statement of the justification for choice of a procurement method other
than open competitive bidding;
Documents relating to pre-qualification and registration of bidders, if
applicable;
Particulars of issue, receipt, opening of the bids and the participating
bidders at each stage;
Requests for clarifications and any reply thereof including the
clarifications given during pre-bid conferences;
Bids evaluated, and documents relating to their evaluation; and
Contracts and Contract Amendments
Complaint handling, correspondences with clients, consultants, banks.

Standards (Canons) of Financial Propriety

Public Procurement like any other expenditure in Government must conform to the
Standards(also called Canons) of Financial Propriety. It may be useful to refer to the relevant
provisions in the General Financial Rules, 2017

13

Rule21.Standardsoffinancialpropriety: Every officer incurring or authorizing
expenditure from public moneys should be guided by high standards of financial
propriety. Every officer should also enforce financial order and strict economy and
see that all relevant financial rules and regulations are observed, by his own office
and by subordinate disbursing officers. Among the principles on which emphasis is
generally laid are the following:i) Every officer is expected to exercise the same vigilance in respect of expenditure
incurred from public moneys as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in
respect of expenditure of his own money.
ii)

The expenditure should not be prima facie more than the occasion demands.

iii) No authority should exercise its powers of sanctioning expenditure to pass an
order which will be directly or indirectly to its own advantage.
iv) Expenditure from public moneys should not be incurred for the benefit of a
particular person or a section of the people, unless a)
a claim for the amount could be enforced in a Court of Law, orb)
expenditure is in pursuance of a recognized policy or custom.

the

v) The amount of allowances granted to meet expenditure of a particular type
should be so regulated that the allowances are not on the whole a source of profit to
the recipients.
vi) While discharging the duties of financial concurrence of any public expenditure,
such authorities subsequent to such decision, shall not be involved in any future
financial/audit/payment responsibilities which may create conflict of interest.

1.9 Public Procurement Infrastructure at the Centre
i)

Procurement Policy Division

Procurement Policy Division (PPD) in Department of Expenditure; Ministry of Finance has
been created to encourage uniformity and harmonisation in public procurement processes
by dissemination of best practices, provision of guidance, oversight and capacity building
and issuing of procurement manuals. However Centralisation of procurement or involvement
in procurement processes is not the intended purpose of creation of PPD.
ii)

Central Public Procurement Portal

Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) has been designed, developed and hosted by
National Informatics Centre (NIC, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology) in
association with Dept. of Expenditure to ensure transparency in the public procurement
process. The primary objective of the Central Public Procurement portal is to provide a
single point access to the information on procurements made across various Ministries and
the Departments. The CPPP has e-publishing and e-procurement modules. It is mandatory
for all Ministries / Departments of the Central Government, Central Public Sector Enterprises
(CPSEs) and Autonomous and Statutory Bodies to publish on the CPPP all their tender
enquiries and information about the resulting contracts. CPPP provides access to
information such as documents relating to pre-qualification, Bidders’ registration, Bidding
documents; details of bidders, their pre-qualification, registration, exclusions/ debarments;
decisions taken regarding prequalification and selection of successful bid. It is also now

14

mandatory to implement end-to-end e-Procurement for all procurements either through
CPPP portal or any other suitable portal.

1.10 Product Reservation and Preferential/Mandatory Purchase from certain
sources

also be given relaxation in prior turnover and prior experience criteria during
the tender process, subject to meeting of quality and technical specifications.
However, there may be circumstances (like procurement of items related to
public safety, health, critical security operations and equipment, etc.) where
procuring entity may prefer the vendor to have prior experience rather than
giving orders to new entities24.
2) Chapter V of the MSMED Act, 2006 also has provision for ensuring timely
payments to the MSE suppliers. The period agreed upon for payment must
not exceed forty-five days after the supplies. For delays in payment the buyer
shall be liable to pay compound interest to the supplier on the delayed
amount at three times of the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank. For
arbitration and conciliation regarding recovery of such payments and
interests, Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council has been setup in
states.

within price band of L1+15 (fifteen) per cent shall also be allowed to supply a
portion of requirement by bringing down their price to L1 price in a situation
where L1 price is from someone other than a MSE and such MSE shall be
allowed to supply up to 25(twenty five) per cent of total tendered value. The
25(twenty five) per cent quantity is to be distributed proportionately among
these bidders, in case there are more than one MSEs within such price band.

Government Ministries /Departments /PSUs shall take necessary steps to develop
appropriate vendors by organizing Vendor Development Programmes (VDPs) or BuyerSeller Meets focused on developing MSEs for procurement through the Government eMarketplace (GeM) portal. In order to develop vendors belonging to MSEs for Public
Procurement Policy, the Ministry of MSME is regularly organizing State Level VDPs and
National Level VDPs under the Procurement and Marketing Support Scheme. For
enhancing participation of MSEs owned by SCs /STs/ Women in Government
procurement, Central Government Ministries/ Departments/ CPSUs have to take the
following steps:
a) Special Vendor Development Programmes/ Buyer-Seller Meets would be
conducted by Departments/ CPSUs for SC/STs and Women.
b) Outreach programmes will be conducted by National Small Industries
Corporation (NSIC) to cover more and more MSEs from SC/STs under its
schemes of consortia formation; and
c) NSIC would open a special window for SCs/ STs under its Single Point
Registration Scheme (SPRS).
d) A National SC/ST hub scheme was launched in October, 2016, for providing
handholding support to SC/ST entrepreneur which is being coordinated /
implemented by the NSIC under this Ministry.

be eligible to bid. As such, the multiple suppliers, who would be awarded the
contract, should be all and only ‘Class I Local suppliers’.
b) In other cases, ‘Class II local suppliers’ and ‘Non local suppliers’ may also
participate in the bidding process along with ‘Class I Local suppliers’ as per
provisions of the Order.
c) If ‘Class I Local suppliers’ qualify for award of contract for at least 50 (fifty)
percent of the tendered quantity in any tender, the contract may be awarded
to all the qualified bidders as per award criteria stipulated in the bid
documents. However, in case ‘Class I Local suppliers’ do not qualify for
award of contract for at least 50 (fifty) percent of the tendered quantity,
purchase preference should be given to the ‘Class I local supplier’ over ‘Class
II local suppliers’/ ‘Non local suppliers’ provided that their quoted rate falls
within 20 (twenty) percent margin of purchase preference of the highest
quoted bidder considered for award of contract so as to ensure that the ‘Class
I Local suppliers’ taken in totality are considered for award of contract for at
least 50 (fifty) percent of the tendered quantity.
d) First purchase preference has to be given to the lowest quoting ‘Class-I local
supplier’, whose quoted rates fall within 20 (twenty) percent margin of
purchase preference, subject to its meeting the prescribed criteria for award
of contract as also the constraint of maximum quantity that can be sourced
from any single supplier. If the lowest quoting ‘Class-I local supplier’, does not
qualify for purchase preference because of aforesaid constraints or does not
accept the offered quantity, an opportunity may be given to next higher
‘Class-I local supplier’, falling within 20 (twenty) percent margin of purchase
preference, and so on.
e) To avoid any ambiguity during bid evaluation process, the procuring entities
may stipulate its own tender specific criteria for award of contract amongst
different bidders including the procedure for purchase preference to ‘Class-I
local supplier’ within the broad policy guidelines stipulated in sub-paras
above.
Exemption of small purchases: Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph
(i), procurements where the estimated value to be procured is less than Rs. 5 lakhs
shall be exempt from the Order. However, it shall be ensured by procuring entities
that procurement is not split for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this Order.

21

v)

Minimum local content: The ‘local content’ requirement to categorize a supplier as
‘Class-I local supplier’ is minimum 50 (fifty) percent. For ‘Class-II local supplier’, the
‘local content’ requirement is minimum 20 (twenty) percent. Nodal Ministry/
Department may prescribe only a higher percentage of minimum local content
requirement to categorize a supplier as ‘Class-I local supplier’/ ‘Class-II local
supplier’. For the items, for which Nodal Ministry/ Department has not prescribed
higher minimum local content notification under the Order, it shall be 50 (fifty) percent
and 20 (twenty) percent for ‘Class-I local supplier’/ ‘Class-II local supplier’
respectively.

vi)

Requirement for specification in advance: The minimum local content, the margin
of purchase preference and the procedure for preference to Make in India shall be
specified in the notice inviting tenders or other form of procurement solicitation and
shall not be varied during a particular procurement transaction.

vii)

Government E-marketplace: In respect of procurement through the Government Emarketplace (GeM) shall, as far as possible, specifically mark the items which meet
the minimum local content while registering the item for display, and shall, wherever
feasible, make provision for automated comparison with purchase preference and
without purchase preference and for obtaining consent of the local supplier in those
cases where purchase preference is to be exercised.

viii)

Verification of local content:
a)

The ‘Class-I local supplier’/ ‘Class-II local supplier’ at the time of tender, bidding or
solicitation shall be required to indicate percentage of local content and provide selfcertification that the item offered meets the local content requirement for ‘Class-I
local supplier’/ ‘Class-II local supplier’, as the case may be. They shall also give
details of the location(s) at which the local value addition is made.
b) In cases of procurement for a value in excess of Rs. 10 crores, the ‘Class-I local
supplier’/ ‘Class-II local supplier’ shall be required to provide a certificate from the
statutory auditor or cost auditor of the company (in the case of companies) or from
a practicing cost accountant or practicing chartered accountant (in respect of
suppliers other than companies) giving the percentage of local content.
c) Decisions on complaints relating to implementation of this Order shall be taken by
the competent authority which is empowered to look into procurement-related
complaints relating to the procuring entity.
d) Nodal Ministries may constitute committees with internal and external experts for
independent verification of self-declarations and auditor’s/ accountant’s certificates
on random basis and in the case of complaints.
e) Nodal Ministries and procuring entities may prescribe fees for such complaints.
f) False declarations will be in breach of the Code of Integrity under Rule 175(1)(i)(h)
of the General Financial Rules for which a bidder or its successors can be debarred
for up to two years as per Rule 151 (iii) of the General Financial Rules along with
such other actions as may be permissible under law.
g) A supplier who has been debarred by any procuring entity for violation of the Order
shall not be eligible for preference under the Order for procurement by any other

22

procuring entity for the duration of the debarment. The debarment for such other
procuring entities shall take effect prospectively from the date on which it comes to
the notice of other procurement entities, in the manner prescribed under paragraph
(h) below.
h) The Department of Expenditure shall issue suitable instructions for the effective and
smooth operation of this process, so that:
1. The fact and duration of debarment for violation of the Order by any procuring
entity are promptly brought to the notice of the Member-Convenor of the
Standing Committee and the Department of Expenditure through the concerned
Ministry /Department or in some other manner;
2. on a periodical basis such cases are consolidated and a centralized list or
decentralized lists of such suppliers with the period of debarment is maintained
and displayed on website(s);
3. in respect of procuring entities other than the one which has carried out the
debarment, the debarment takes effect prospectively from the date of uploading
on the website(s) in the such a manner that ongoing procurements are not
disrupted.
ix)

Specifications in Tenders and other procurement solicitations:
a) Every procuring entity shall ensure that the eligibility conditions in respect of previous
experience fixed in any tender or solicitation do not require proof of supply in other
countries or proof of exports.
b) Procuring entities shall endeavour to see that eligibility conditions, including on
matters like turnover, production capability and financial strength do not result in
unreasonable exclusion of ‘Class-I local supplier’/ ‘Class-II local supplier’ who would
otherwise be eligible, beyond what is essential for ensuring quality or
creditworthiness of the supplier.
c) Procuring entities shall review all existing eligibility norms and conditions with
reference to sub-paragraphs (viii) (a) and (b) above.
d) Reciprocity Clause
1. When a Nodal Ministry/Department identifies that Indian suppliers of an item
are not allowed to participate and/ or compete in procurement by any foreign
government, due to restrictive tender conditions which have direct or indirect
effect of barring Indian companies such as registration in the procuring
country, execution of projects of specific value in the procuring country etc., it
shall provide such details to all its procuring entities including CMDs/CEOs of
PSEs/PSUs, State Governments and other procurement agencies under their
administrative control and GeM for appropriate reciprocal action.
2. Entities of countries which have been identified by the nodal
Ministry/Department as not allowing Indian companies to participate in their
Government procurement for any item related to that nodal Ministry shall not
be allowed to participate in Government procurement in India for all items
related to that nodal Ministry/ Department, except for the list of items
published by the Ministry/ Department permitting their participation.
3. The stipulation in (2) above shall be part of all tenders invited by the Central
Government procuring entities stated in (1) above. All purchases on GeM

23

shall also necessarily have the above provisions for items identified by nodal
Ministry/ Department.
4. State Governments should be encouraged to incorporate similar provisions in
their respective tenders.
5. The term 'entity' of a country shall have the same meaning as under the FDI
Policy of DPIIT as amended from time to time.
e) Specifying foreign certifications/ unreasonable technical specifications/ brands/
models in the bid document is restrictive and discriminatory practice against local
suppliers. If foreign certification is required to be stipulated because of nonavailability of Indian Standards and/or for any other reason, the same shall be done
only after written approval of Secretary of the Department concerned or any other
Authority having been designated such power by the Secretary of the Department
concerned.
f) “All administrative Ministries/Departments whose procurement exceeds Rs. 1000
Crore per annum shall notify/ update their procurement projections every year,
including those of the PSEs/PSUs, for the next 5 years on their respective website.”
x)

Action for non-compliance of the Provisions of the Order: In case restrictive or
discriminatory conditions against domestic suppliers are included in bid documents, an
inquiry shall be conducted by the Administrative Department undertaking the
procurement (including procurement by any entity under its administrative control) to fix
responsibility for the same. Thereafter, appropriate action, administrative or otherwise,
shall be taken against erring officials of procurement entities under relevant provisions.
Intimation on all such actions shall be sent to the Standing Committee.

xi) Assessment of supply base by Nodal Ministries: The Nodal Ministry shall keep in
view the domestic manufacturing / supply base and assess the available capacity and
the extent of local competition while identifying items and prescribing the higher
minimum local content or the manner of its calculation, with a view to avoiding cost
increase from the operation of this Order.
xii) Increase in minimum local content: The Nodal Ministry may annually review the local
content requirements with a view to increasing them, subject to availability of sufficient
local competition with adequate quality.
xiii) Manufacture under license/ technology collaboration agreements with phased
indigenization
a) While notifying the minimum local content, Nodal Ministries may make special
provisions for exempting suppliers from meeting the stipulated local content if the
product is being manufactured in India under a license from a foreign manufacturer
who holds intellectual property rights and where there is a technology collaboration
agreement / transfer of technology agreement for indigenous manufacture of a
product developed abroad with clear phasing of increase in local content.
b) In procurement of all goods, services or works in respect of which there is substantial
quantity of public procurement and for which the nodal ministry has not notified that
there is sufficient local capacity and local competition, the concerned nodal ministry
shall notify an upper threshold value of procurement beyond which foreign

24

companies shall enter into a joint venture with an Indian company to participate in the
tender. Procuring entities, while procuring such items beyond the notified threshold
value, shall prescribe in their respective tenders that foreign companies may enter
into a joint venture with an Indian company to participate in the tender. The procuring
Ministries/Departments shall also make special provisions for exempting such joint
ventures from meeting the stipulated minimum local content requirement, which shall
be increased in a phased manner.
xiv)
Powers to grant exemption and to reduce minimum local content: The
administrative Department undertaking the procurement (including procurement by any
entity under its administrative control), with the approval of their Minister-in-charge, may by
written order, for reasons to be recorded in writing,
1. reduce the minimum local content below the prescribed level; or
2. reduce the margin of purchase preference below 20 (twenty) percent; or
3. exempt any particular item or supplying entities from the operation of this
Order or any part of the Order.
A copy of every such order shall be provided to the Standing Committee and concerned
Nodal Ministry / Department. The Nodal Ministry / Department concerned will continue to
have the power to vary its notification on Minimum Local Content.
xv)

Chapter 2: Need assessment, formulation of Specifications and
Procurement Planning
2.1

Need Assessment

2.1.1 Procurements should be initiated only based on an indent from the user Department.
The authority in the user Department initiating the indent for procurement shall first
determine the need (including anticipated requirement) for the subject matter of the
procurement. Description and Specification of Need assessment is of fundamental
importance in ensuring value for money, transparency, competition and level playing field in
procurement. The user Department shall maintain all documents relating to the
determination and technical/financial/budgetary approvals of the need for procurement.
During need assessments, the following matters are decided to comply with the
‘Procurement Guidelines’:
i)

The expression/description of the need keeping in view the Value for Money (VfM)
and to ensure wide competition. Therefore to the extent practicable it should be:
a) Unambiguous, complete, using common terminology prevalent in relevant trade;
b) In accordance with the guidelines prescribed if any in this regard;
c) Except in case of proprietary purchase from a selected single source, reference
to brand names, catalogue numbers or other details that limit any materials or
items to specific manufacturer(s) should be avoided as far as possible. Where
unavoidable, such item descriptions should always be followed by the words “or
substantially equivalent”.
ii) Method of satisfying it (owning/leasing/hiring/outsourcing or through Public Private
Partnership (PPP), and so on) may be determined as per policies declared in this regard
or based on a techno-economic evaluation (using life cycle cost, if feasible) of various
alternative methods of satisfaction of the need and compatibility and inter-operability with
existing infrastructure or systems.
iii) The quantity of the subject matter of procurement, commensurate with economy:
a) Care should be taken not to make unnecessary procurements much in advance of
actual requirements, if such procurement is likely to be unprofitable to the
Government, coupled with unwarranted inventory-carrying cost. Where sales,
consumption or usage limits of requirements have been laid down by the Competent
Authority (CA), the officer signing the indent should also certify that the prescribed
scales or limits are not exceeded. The authority preparing the indent shall neither
package nor divide its procurement or take any other action so as to limit competition
among potential bidders or to avoid its obligations under ‘Procurement Guidelines’.
Provided that in the interest of efficiency, economy, timely completion or supply,
wider competition or access to MSEs, a indenting or procuring authority may, for
reasons to be recorded in writing, divide its procurement into appropriate packages,
or club requirements of other users for procurement. Some requirements e.g. IT
Systems may have elements of Goods, Works and Services. It could be either sliced
into of Goods, Works and Services elements or combined into a package. Such
decisions for slicing or packaging should be based on technical and VfM

considerations. It is also necessary to round off the calculated quantity to the nearest
wagon load/truck load/package to economise on transportation; and
b) Units of quantity are a very important parameter. Some items may be manufactured
in metric tons but may be used in units of numbers or units of lengths (for example,
steel sheets/structural). For the sake of transparency, it is important to buy an item in
units of manufacture. For example, it is better to buy steel/structural in units of weight
since it has a tolerance in weight per unit of length; this usually works to the
disadvantage of the buyer if it is bought in units of length. The buying and issuing
units of an item may be different – but should be standardised.
c) Time-schedule and place of product/work/service delivery: Need assessment and
generation of indent for procurement should be done sufficiently in advance of the
time when goods are required. Delays in need assessment have adverse impact on
the value for money and transparency. Great care is required to be exercised in filling
up realistic dates for the requirement of material. The procuring entity should be
allowed time in accordance with the establishment lead times. In urgent cases, the
procuring entity may entertain indents providing shorter periods but such urgencies
should be approved by the authority empowered to grant administrative approval for
the indent and must be accompanied by proper justification.
d) Formulation of Specification to ensure value for money, transparency, level playing
field and ensuring widest competition. This is further detailed in subsequent para.
e) Estimation of Cost:
1. The estimated cost in the indent is a vital element in various procurement
processes, approvals and establishing reasonableness of prices at the time of
evaluation of the bids. Therefore, it should be worked out in a realistic and
objective manner. The prevailing market price ascertained through a market
survey or budgetary quotations from one or more prospective suppliers or
published catalogues/Maximum Retail Price (MRP) printed on the item is the
main source for establishing the estimated cost of items for which there no
historic data available. It may be noted that MRPs usually include significant
margins for distributors, wholesalers and retailers;
2. For equipment/craft which are uniquely custom-built to buyer’s specifications, the
best way to get a fair assessment of costs is by obtaining budgetary quotes from
potential parties. Ideally, there should be three quotes. However, there is need to
have a time schedule for receipt of quotes to ensure some timeframe for this
activity. Thus:
a) An attempt should be made to obtain as many budgetary quotes as possible
from reputed/potential firms and a time of 21 (twenty-one) days be indicated
therefore. In the event of receipt of less than three budgetary quotes, two
extensions of up to 10 (ten) days each may be considered; and
b) In the event of non-availability of three quotes within the above extended
period, the estimates should be prepared on the basis of the number of
budgetary quote(s) received, which may even be one; and where more than
one budgetary quote is received, the estimate should be framed on an
average of the quotes which will reduce variations and fluctuations;

28

3. Other methods for establishing the estimated cost in the indent and tender
evaluation are:
a) Estimated rate in past indents of the same goods;
b) Last purchase price of this or similar or nearly equivalent requirements;
c) Costing analysis based on costs of various components/raw materials of the
item;
d) Rough assessment from the price of the assembly/machine of which the
item is a part or vice versa;
e) Through the internal or external expert costing agencies; and
f)

As a last resort, rough assessment from the opportunity cost of not using
this item at all;

iv)

These methods are not mutually exclusive and can be supplemented with
escalations to cater for inflation, price increases of raw materials, labour, energy,
statutory changes, price indices, and so on, to make them usable in conditions
prevailing currently. In case of foreign currencies, the rate should be reduced to a
common denomination of Indian Rupees. Price indices can be obtained from the
following websites. Some may require prior free registration and some paid

2.2

Formulation of Technical specifications (TS)

2.2.1 The procuring authority should ensure that specifications are developed to ensure
VfM, level playing field and wide competition in procurement [Rule 173 (ix) of GFR 2017].
The TS constitute the benchmarks against which the procuring entity will verify the technical
responsiveness of bids and, subsequently, evaluate the bids. Therefore, well-defined TS will
facilitate the preparation of responsive bids by bidders as well as examination, evaluation
and comparison of the bids by the procuring entity. It would also help in ensuring the quality
of the supplied goods. The procuring authority should ensure that the specification should:
i)

Provides a level playing field and ensures the widest competition; and

ii)

Be unambiguous, precise, objective, functional, broad based/generic, standardised
(for items procured repeatedly) and measurable. TS should be broad enough to

29

avoid restrictions on workmanship, materials and equipment commonly used in
manufacturing similar kinds of goods;
iii)

Set out the required technical, qualitative and performance characteristics to meet
just the bare essential needs of the procuring entity without including superfluous and
non-essential features, which may result in unwarranted expenditure;

iv)

Normally be based on standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS),
wherever such standards exist. Preference should be given to procure the goods
which carry the BIS mark. In the absence of BIS standards, TS may be based on the
relevant International standards. Provided that an indenting authority may, for
reasons to be recorded in writing, base the TS on equivalent international standards
even in cases where BIS standards exist. For any deviations from Indian standards
or for any additional parameters for better performance, specific reasons for
deviations/modifications should be duly recorded with the approval of the CA. Where
the technical parameters are only marginally different, Indian standards may be
specified and the Departmental specifications could cover only such additional details
as packing, marking, inspection, and so on, as are specially required to be complied
for a particular end use;

v)

All dimensions incorporated in the specifications shall be indicated in metric units. If
due to some unavoidable reasons, dimensions in FPS units are to be mentioned, the
corresponding equivalents in the metric system must also be indicated.

vi)

Comply with sustainability criteria and legal requirements of environment or pollution
control and other mandatory and statutory regulations, or internal guidelines, if any,
applicable to the goods to be purchased;

vii)

Make use of best practices. examples of specifications from successful similar
procurements in the other organisations or sector may provide a sound basis for
drafting the TS;

viii)

Commensurate with VfM, avoid procurement of obsolete goods and require that all
goods and materials be new, unused and of the most recent or current models and
that they incorporate all recent improvements in design and materials, unless
provided for otherwise in the bidding documents;

ix)

Should have emphasis on factors such as efficiency, optimum fuel/power
consumption, use of environmental-friendly materials, reduced noise and emission
levels, low maintenance cost, and so on. Government of India has set up the Bureau
of Energy Efficiency (BEE) (http://www.bee-india.nic.in) on March 1, 2002 under the
provisions of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001, with the primary objective of
reducing the energy intensity of the Indian economy. The Bureau initiated the
Standards & Labelling Programme for equipment and appliances in 2006to provide
the consumer an informed choice about the energy saving and thereby the cost
saving potential of the relevant marketed product. The scheme is invoked for 21
equipment/appliances, i.e. Room Air Conditioners, RAC(Cassette, Floor Standing
Tower, Ceiling, Corner AC), Tubular Fluorescent Tube Lights, Frost Free
Refrigerators, Distribution Transformers, Direct Cool Refrigerator, Electric storage
type geyser, Color TVs, Induction Motors, Ceiling fans, Agricultural pump sets, LPG
stoves, Washing machine, Laptops, Ballast, Office automation products, Solid State
Inverter, Diesel Engine Driven Monoset Pumps for Agricultural Purposes, Diesel

30

Generator, Inverter AC and LED Lamps. Of which the first 8 products have been
notified under mandatory labelling since 7thJanuary, 2010. The other appliances are
presently under voluntary labelling phase. The energy efficiency labelling programs
under BEE are intended to reduce the energy consumption of appliance without
diminishing the services it provides to consumers. More the stars higher the efficient
is the appliance. The threshold ratings prescribed by the Ministry of Finance are:
Appliance
Threshold Star Rating
Split Air conditioners

5 Star (under normal conditions where annual usages are
expected to be more than 1000 Hrs)
3 Star (where usage of AC is limited e.g. in conference rooms)

Frost
Refrigerators

Free 4 Star

Ceiling Fans

5 Star

Water Heaters

5 Star

We should try to build either the BEE Star rating where applicable and minimum energy
efficiency where such star ratings are not yet available, into the TS (in accordance with Rule
173 (xvii) of GFR 2017). Such benchmarking illustrates use of neutral and dependable
benchmarking in procurement of sustainable environmentally favourable goods by way of
appropriately formulated Technical Specifications. In a similar fashion, other Type III Ecolabels as per ISO 14020 or voluntary Environmental Standard can be used for specifying
environmental sustainability criteria.

Discourage procurement involving evaluation of samples: According to the
existing guidelines on public procurement of goods, purchase in accordance with a
sample should not be usually undertaken. Calling 31 for a sample along with the
tender and deciding on the basis of evaluation of the sample may NOT be done. In
certain specifications, there may be a built-in sample clause.
Usually
such
clauses are stipulated to illustrate indeterminable characteristics such as shade/tone,
make-up, feel, finish and workmanship, and so on. In some specifications, there may
not be a sample clause but such indeterminable characteristics are left to be agreed
to between the seller and buyer. One way to procure/indigenise certain spares whose
drawings/specifications are not available is to procure in accordance with an
available sample of the part. In such cases, supply must be in conformity with an
agreed reference sample in such respects only, whereas for the remaining
characteristics it must be in conformity with the laid down drawings/specifications.
Procurement of such items should be decided on the basis of detailed
specifications/drawings and no sample should be called for or evaluated along with
the bids. If desired, a purchaser’s reference sample may be displayed for prospective
tenderers to illustrate the desired indeterminable characteristics, which final supplies
from successful bidder(s) will have to meet in addition to the specifications/drawings.
If required, in addition to the purchaser’s reference sample, the provision for the
submission of a pre-production sample matching the purchaser’s sample by

CVC’s circular: 2EE-1-CTE-3 dated 15 October 2003, URL: http://cvc.gov.in/eecte32k3.pdf

31

successful bidder(s) may be stipulated for indeterminable characteristics, before
giving clearance for bulk production of the supply. The Indent for items which are to
be procured in accordance with a sample must be accompanied with three sealed
samples as far as possible;
2.2.2

Essential Technical particulars

The essential Technical particulars to be specified in the tender document shall include the
following to the extent applicable for a particular purchase:
i)
ii)

iii)
iv)
v)
vi)
vii)

xii)

Scope of supply and, also, end use of the required goods;
All essential technical, qualitative, functional, environmental and performance
characteristics and requirements (such as material composition, physical, dimensions
and tolerances, workmanship and manufacturing process wherever applicable; test
schedule; if any), including guaranteed or acceptable maximum or minimum values,
as appropriate. Whenever necessary, the user may include an additional format for
guaranteed technical parameters (as an attachment to the bid submission sheet),
where the bidder shall provide detailed information on such technical performance
characteristics in reference to the corresponding acceptable or guaranteed values;
Drawings;
Requirement of the BIS mark, where applicable, mentioning all parameters where
such a specification provides options;
Requirement of an advance sample, if any, at the post contract stage before bulk
production;
Special requirements of preservation, packing and marking, if any;

Requirements of special tests or type test certificate or type approval for compliance
of statutory requirements with reference to pollution, emission, noise, if any;
Other additional work and/or related services required to achieve full
delivery/completion, installation, commissioning, training, technical support, aftersales service and Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) requirements, if any;
Warranty requirements;
Qualification criteria of the bidders, if any; and
Any other aspects peculiar to the goods in question such as shelf life of the
equipment, and so on.

2.3
Obtaining Technical, Administrative
Approvals and signing of Indents

and

Budgetary

Sanctions/

Procuring Entities may lay down a schedule of powers for administrative and budgetary
approval of indents generated for procurement of goods (Please refer to Annexure 2Cfor
suggested Structure of SoPP). Before granting such approvals, it should be certified that
funds in the budget are available and liability for this indent is noted against the total
available budget. In case the time schedule of delivery is urgent (or shorter than usual leadtime) an urgency certificate should be recorded justifying the urgency. The indenting
authority may submit an indent in form of a Purchase Requisition (Annexure 3) to the
procuring entity, giving it adequate time for procurement. Indenters should monitor the
progress of the Indents submitted by them. For this purpose, a register may be maintained in
the format provided in Annexure4A. On receipt in the procuring authority, progress of such

33

Indents should be monitored for which a register may be maintained in the format provided
in Annexure 4B.

2.4

Procurement Planning

2.4.1 After receipt of the Indent, the procuring entity should take following decisions to
initiate procurement, to ensure conformity to the Procurement Guidelines:
i)

Within 10 (Ten) working days of receipt of the indent from the user Department, the
procuring authorities should critically review the description and TS enclosed with the
indent for completeness/approvals/funding, VfM and possibility of the widest
competition and seek clarifications from the indenting officer, if needed, before
initiating such procurement;

ii)

Reassessment of the quantity and appropriate aggregation of quantities of
various users: The procuring authority shall normally neither package nor divide its
procurement or take any other action so as to limit competition among bidders or to
avoid the necessity of obtaining the sanction of higher authority required with
reference to the estimated value of the total demand (Rule 157 of GFR 2017).
Provided that in the interest of efficiency, economy, timely completion or supply,
wider competition or access to MSEs, a procuring authority may, for reasons to be
recorded in writing, divide its procurement into appropriate packages, or club
requirements of other users for procurement. Packaging of the contract and
procurement planning should be done keeping in view the availability and possibility
of eliciting the interest of the qualified firms; effective competition for the type and
size of the contract; and access to MSEs. For example for a particular contract,
material to be procured may constitute more than 50 (fifty) per cent of the total cost of
works or there are services which are a mix of consultancy services with substantial
element of goods, such as procurement of an IT system. Such procurement could be
done as a single composite contract comprising all components or divided into
separate contracts for each category of procurement. In all such situations, the
dominant aspect of the requirement and value for money aspects of a composite allinclusive contract versus dividing the contract into respective categories should be
carefully examined at the time of Need assessment/ Procurement Planning. This is a
crucial stage of decision-making in procurement planning for a better outcome and
for VfM considerations;

iii)

Determine and declare in documents, any limitation on participation of bidders as per
the Government’s procurement policy regarding preference to certain sections of
industry, if any. The procuring entity shall not establish any requirement aimed at
limiting participation of bidders in the procurement process that discriminates against
or amongst bidders or against any category thereof except to lay down a reasonable
and justifiable eligibility or pre-qualification criteria for the bidders;

iv)

Selection of a system of bidding (single/two stage; single/two bids; suitability for eprocurement or reverse auction);

v)

Select the mode of procurement (open tenders, limited tenders, single tenders, and
so on);

vi)

Decisions on the timeframe for completing various stages of procurement, which
should be declared in the pre-qualification/bidder registration or bidding documents.

34

The procuring entity should endeavour to adhere to the time limit so decided and
record reasons for any modification of such limits; and
vii)

Integrated procurement plan should be prepared for goods, works and services for
the ensuing financial year based on the latest cost estimates, and realistic time
schedule for procurement activities and contract implementation and thus schedule
and stagger the procurements over the year with a view to ensure an even load on
the procuring entity and the market and also to co-ordinate matching procurements of
Goods, Works and Services for a project;

2.4.2 The procuring entity may publish information regarding the planned procurement
activities for the forthcoming year or years on the central public procurement portal and
website/ e-Procurement portal used by the procuring entity with a caveat that such
publication shall not be construed as initiation of a procurement process and cast any
obligation on the procuring entity to issue the bidding document or confer any right on
prospective bidders.

Packaging, bundling and slicing of

Lay down a clear policy for packaging and

kept in view and bidders may be allowed to
bid for slices of the package by depositing

Chapter 3: Supplier Relationship Management
3.1

Supplier Relationship Management

Supplier Relationship Management comprises the following functions:
i)
Ensuring compliance of suppliers to the Code of Integrity for Public Procurement and
Integrity Pact (CIPP) if stipulated in Bid Documents;
ii)
Holiday listing; removal from the list of registered suppliers and banning/debarment
of firms; and
iii)
Development of new sources and registration of suppliers.

3.2

Code of Integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP)

3.2.1 Public procurement is perceived to be prone to corruption and ethical risks. To
mitigate this, the officials of Procuring Entities involved in procurement and the bidders/
suppliers must abide by the following Code of Integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP). All
Procuring officials may be asked to sign declarations to this effect periodically and in various
Procurement decisions (including Need Assessment). The bidders/ suppliers should be
asked to sign a declaration about abiding by a Code of Integrity for Public Procurement in
registration applications and in bid documents, with a warning that, in case of any
transgression of this code, its name is not only liable to be removed from the list of
registered suppliers, but it would be liable for other punitive actions such as cancellation of
contracts, banning and blacklisting or action in Competition Commission of India, and so on.
(Rule 175 of GFR 2017)
3.2.2 Code of Integrity for Public Procurement: Procuring authorities as well as bidders,
suppliers, contractors and consultants should observe the highest standard of ethics and
should not indulge in the following prohibited practices, either directly or indirectly, at any
stage during the procurement process or during execution of resultant contracts:
i)

“Corrupt practice”: making offers, solicitation or acceptance of bribe, rewards or
gifts or any material benefit, in exchange for an unfair advantage in the procurement
process or to otherwise influence the procurement process or contract execution;

ii)

“Fraudulent practice”: any omission or misrepresentation that may mislead or
attempt to mislead so that financial or other benefits may be obtained or an obligation
avoided. This includes making false declaration or providing false information for
participation in a tender process or to secure a contract or in execution of the
contract;

iii)

“Anti-competitive practice”: any collusion, bid rigging or anti-competitive
arrangement, or any other practice coming under the purview of The Competition
Act, 2002, between two or more bidders, with or without the knowledge of the
procuring entity, that may impair the transparency, fairness and the progress of the
procurement process or to establish bid prices at artificial, non-competitive levels;

iv)

“Coercive practice”: harming or threatening to harm, persons or their property to
influence their participation in the procurement process or affect the execution of a
contract;

36

v)

“Conflict of interest”: participation by a bidding firm or any of its affiliates that are
either involved in the consultancy contract to which this procurement is linked; or if
they are part of more than one bid in the procurement; or if the bidding firm or their
personnel have relationships or financial or business transactions with any official of
procuring entity who are directly or indirectly related to tender or execution process of
contract; or improper use of information obtained by the (prospective) bidder from the
procuring entity with an intent to gain unfair advantage in the procurement process or
for personal gain; and

vi)

“Obstructive practice”: materially impede the procuring entity’s investigation into
allegations of one or more of the above mentioned prohibited practices either by
deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering; or by concealing of evidence material to
the investigation; or by making false statements to investigators and/or by
threatening, harassing or intimidating any party to prevent it from disclosing its
knowledge of matters relevant to the investigation or from pursuing the investigation;
or by impeding the procuring entity’s rights of audit or access to information;

3.2.3

Obligations for Proactive Disclosures

i)

Procuring authorities as well as bidders, suppliers, contractors and consultants, are
obliged under Code of Integrity for Public Procurement to suo-moto proactively
declare any conflicts of interest (coming under the definition mentioned above – preexisting or as and as soon as these arise at any stage) in any procurement process
or execution of contract. Failure to do so would amount to violation of this code of
integrity; and

ii)

Any bidder must declare, whether asked or not in a bid document, any previous
transgressions of such a code of integrity with any entity in any country during the
last three years or of being debarred by any other procuring entity. Failure to do so
would amount to violation of this code of integrity.

iii)

To encourage voluntary disclosures, such declarations would not mean automatic
disqualification for the bidder making such declarations. The declared conflict of
interest may be evaluated and mitigation steps, if possible, may be taken by the
procuring entity. Similarly voluntary reporting of previous transgressions of Code of
Integrity elsewhere may be evaluated and barring cases of various grades of
debarment, an alert watch may be kept on the bidder’s actions in the tender and
subsequent contract.

3.2.4 Punitive Provisions: Without prejudice to and in addition to the rights of the
procuring entity to other penal provisions as per the bid documents or contract, if the
procuring entity comes to a conclusion that a (prospective) bidder/supplier, directly or
through an agent, has violated this code of integrity in competing for the contract or in
executing a contract, the procuring entity may take appropriate measures including one or
more of the following:
i)

if his bids are under consideration in any procurement
a) Forfeiture or encashment of bid security
b) calling off of any pre-contract negotiations, and;
c) rejection and exclusion of the bidder from the procurement process

37

ii)

if a contract has already been awarded
a) Cancellation of the relevant contract and recovery of compensation for loss
incurred by the procuring entity,;
b) Forfeiture or encashment of any other security or bond relating to the
procurement;
c) Recovery of payments including advance payments, if any, made by the
procuring entity along with interest thereon at the prevailing rate;

iii)

Provisions in addition to above:
a) Removal from the list of registered suppliers and banning/debarment of the
bidder from participation in future procurements of the procuring entity for a
period not less than one year;
b) In case of anti-competitive practices, information for further processing may be
filed under a signature of the Joint Secretary level officer, with the Competition
Commission of India;
c) Initiation of suitable disciplinary or criminal proceedings against any individual or
staff found responsible.

3.2.5 Conduct of Public Servants in Public Procurement - Risks and Mitigations
Risk
Hospitality:
Hospitality
(including
facilitation of travel, lodging, boarding and
entertainment during official or unofficial
programs) from suppliers may tend to
cross the limits of ethical/ occasional/
routine/modest/ normal business practice.
Officials sent to firm’s premises for
inspections/ meetings may mistakenly
presume entitlement to hospitality from
the firm, even if other arrangements are
available at the location.

Mitigation
Hospitality must never be solicited, directly or
indirectly. The frequency, scale and number of
officials availing hospitality should not be
allowed to identify the recipient in a public way
with any particular contractor, supplier or
service provider or raise doubts about its
neutrality. It should not involve significant travel,
overnight accommodation or trips abroad.
Particular care should be taken in relation to
offers of hospitality from firms (say participating
in current or imminent tenders or its execution)
who stand to derive a personal or commercial
benefit from their relationship with the recipient.

Gifts: Gifts from suppliers may tend to
cross the limits of ethical/ occasional/
routine/modest/ normal business practice,
especially on festive season. Since the
value of the gift may not be known to the
recipient, it may cause inadvertent
violation of Conduct rules.

Gifts must never be solicited, directly or
indirectly. An official should not accept and
retain gifts more valuable than the limit as laid
down in the conduct rules. Cash, gift cheques
or any vouchers that may be exchanged for
cash may not be accepted regardless of the
amount. Particular care should be taken in
relation to gifts from firms (say participating in
current or imminent tenders or its execution)
who stand to derive a personal or commercial
benefit from their relationship with the recipient.
Any gift received inadvertently in violation of

above, must immediately either be returned or
else reported and deposited in Toshakhana/
Treasury.

Private
Purchases
from
Official
Suppliers: Procuring Officials may
mistakenly consider it innocuous to seek
discounts in private procurements from
suppliers having official dealings or its
associates(especially from Rate Contract
holders).

Officials involved in Public Procurement must
never indulge in any non-official pecuniary
transaction with the contractors, suppliers or
service providers with whom they have official
dealings; including seeking or accepting special
facilities or discounts on private purchases
(particularly same items which are being
ordered officially on rate contracts).

Sponsorship of Events: Procuring
Officials may mistakenly consider it
innocuous to seek financial favours
(donations, advertisements for souvenirs,
and contributions in cash or kind) in
relation to sponsoring of cultural, social,
charitable, religious, or sporting events, in
the false belief that since he/she is
personally not benefitted, it would not be a
violation of CIPP.

Officials involved in Public Procurement must
never indulge in any non-official pecuniary
transaction with the contractors, suppliers or
service providers with whom they have official
dealings; including soliciting of sponsorship for
unofficial and private cultural, social, sporting,
religious, charitable or similar organisations or
events.

3.3

Integrity Pact (IP)

The Pre-bid Integrity Pact is a tool to help Governments, businesses and civil society to fight
corruption in public contracting. It binds both buyers and sellers to ethical conduct and
transparency in all activities from pre-selection of bidders, bidding and contracting,
implementation, completion and operation related to the contract. This removes insecurity of
Bidders, that while they themselves may abjure Bribery, but their competitors may resort to it
and win contract by unfair means.
Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure have mandated 32 Ministries/ Departments
and their attached/ subordinate offices (including autonomous bodies) to incorporate
Integrity Pact by, depending on the nature of procurements/ contracts above a threshold
value. The nature of procurement and threshold of value is to be decided by the Ministries/
Departments with approval of the Minister in charge. As guidance, the threshold should be
such as to cover bulk (80-90% - eighty to ninety percent by value) of its procurement
expenditure.
“The pact essentially envisages an agreement between the prospective vendors/bidders and
the buyer, committing the persons/officials of both sides, not to resort to any corrupt

32

OM No.14(12)/ 2008- E-ll(A) dated 19th July 2011

39

practices in any aspect/stage of the contract. Only those vendors/bidders, who commit
themselves to such a Pact with the buyer, would be considered competent to participate in
the bidding process. In other words, entering into this Pact would be a preliminary
qualification. The essential ingredients of the Pact include:

1) Promise on the part of the Procuring Entity to treat all bidders with equity and reason and
not to seek or accept any benefit, which is not legally available;

2) Promise on the part of bidders not to offer any benefit to the employees of the Procuring
Entity not available legally and also not to commit any offence under Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 or Indian Penal Code 1860;

3) Promise on the part of Bidders not to enter into any undisclosed agreement or
understanding with other bidders with respect to prices, specifications, certifications,
subsidiary contracts, etc;

4) Undertaking (as part of Fall Clause) by the Bidders that they have not and will not sell
the same material/ equipment at prices lower than the bid price;

5) Foreign bidders to disclose the name and address of agents and representatives in India
and Indian Bidders to disclose their foreign principals or associates;

6) Bidders to disclose the payments to be made by them to agents / brokers or any other
intermediary;

7) Bidders to disclose any past transgressions committed over the specified period with any
other company in India or Abroad that may impinge on the anti corruption principle;

8) Integrity Pact lays down the punitive actions for any violation;
9) Integrity Pact (IP) would be implemented through a panel of Independent External
Monitors (IEMs):shall be appointed by the organization in consultation with Central
Vigilance Commission. Names and contact details of the Independent External
Monitor(s) should be listed in Notice Inviting Tender (NIT). The IEM would review
independently and objectively, whether and to what extent parties have complied with
their obligations under the Pact. Government of India organizations and Public Sector
Undertakings desirous of implementing Integrity Pact are required to select at most three
persons (below the age of 70 (seventy) years) of high integrity and reputation as
Independent External Monitors (IEM) after due diligence and forward to the CVC for its
approval. Only those officers of Government of India Departments or Public Sector
Undertakings, who have retired from top management positions, would be considered for
appointment as IEM, provided they are neither serving or retired from the same
organization. Eminent persons, retired judges of High/ Supreme Courts, executives of
private sector of considerable eminence could also be considered for functioning as
Independent External Monitors. The appointment of Independent External Monitors
would be for an initial period of three years and could be extended for another term of
two years (maximum tenure of five years).Names and contact details of the Independent
External Monitor(s) should be listed in Notice Inviting Tender (NIT).

10) In tenders meeting the criteria of threshold value/ nature of procurement: Integrity
Pact clause and format should be included in the Bid Documents. Each page of such
Integrity pact proforma would be duly signed by Purchaser’s competent signatory. All

40

pages of the Integrity Pact are to be returned by the bidder (along with the technical bid)
duly signed by the same signatory who signed the bid, i.e. who is duly authorized to sign
the bid and to make binding commitments on behalf of his company. Any bid not
accompanied by Integrity Pact duly signed by the bidder shall be considered to be a nonresponsive bid and shall be rejected straightway.

11) Role / Functions of IEMs: The Monitors would not be subject to instructions by the
representatives of the parties and should perform their functions neutrally and
independently. They would review independently and objectively, whether and to what
extent parties have complied with their obligations under the Integrity Pact. For this
purpose, they would have access to all contract documents / books of accounts of the
bidders in case of any allegation of violation of any provisions of the Integrity Pact or
payment of commission, whenever required. The IEMs will have the option to participate
in such meetings among the parties related to the project provided such meetings could
have an impact on the contractual relations between the parties. Ideally all IEMs of an
organization should meet once every two months to take stock of ongoing tendering
process. The IEMs would examine all complaints received by them and give their
recommendations / views to the designated officer of the Procuring Entity, at the earliest.
The Monitors would also inform the Procuring Entity, if they notice or have reason to
believe, a violation of the Integrity Pact. They may also send their report directly to the
Central Vigilance Commission, in case of suspicion of serious irregularities requiring
legal/ administrative action. At least one IEM would be invariably cited in the NIT.
However for ensuring the desired transparency and objectivity in dealing with the
complaints arising out of any tendering process, the matter should be examined by the
full panel of IEMs, who would look into the records, conduct an investigation, and submit
their joint recommendations. The recommendations of IEMs would be in the nature of
advice and would not be legally binding. IEMs may not be equated with consultants in
the Procuring Entity. Their role is independent in nature and the advice once tendered
would not be subject to review. The role of the Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of Procuring
Entity shall remain unaffected by the presence of IEMs. A matter being examined by the
IEMs can be separately investigated by the CVO, if a complaint is received by him or
directed to him by the CVC. As per para 5.13 of CVC OM No. 05/01/22 issued vide letter
No. 015/VGL/091 dated 25.01.2022, in the event of any dispute between the
management and the contractor relating to those contracts where Integrity Pact is
applicable, in case, both the parties are agreeable, they may try to settle dispute through
mediation before the panel of IEMs in a time bound manner. If required, the
organizations may adopt any mediation rules for this purpose. In case, the dispute
remains unresolved even after mediation by the panel of IEMs, the organization may
take further action as per the terms & conditions of the contract.

3.4

Development of New Sources and Registration of Suppliers

3.4.1 Ensuring an up-to-date and current list of registered, capable and competent
suppliers facilitates efficiency, economy and promotion of competition in public procurement,
especially where open tendering is not resorted to. The list may be referred to while floating
a limited tender/local purchase/direct contracting. For such tenders, it may be possible to
skip bidder qualification so as to avoid unnecessary repetition/duplication of records thereby
saving time, especially in the case of emergency procurement. For goods and services not
available on GeM, Head of Ministry/ Department may also register suppliers of goods and

41

services which are specifically required by that Department or Office, periodically.
Registration of the supplier should be done following a fair, transparent and reasonable
procedure and after giving due publicity. Such registered suppliers should be boarded on
GeM as and when the item or service gets listed on GeM. The list of registered suppliers for
the subject matter of procurement be exhibited on websites of the Procuring Entity/ their eProcurement portals.]33.
3.4.2 Ministries / Departments with a significant volume of procurements may follow their
own policies and procedures for registration of vendors, if already existing. The policies and
procedures for registration described below is for guidance of Ministries/ Departments, who
do not have their own laid down policies/ procedures for registration. The Ministry/
Department shall notify the authorities competent to deal with the applications and grant
registrations, along with their jurisdictions. The appellate authority shall be at least one level
above the registering authority or as designated by the Ministry/ Department.
3.4.3 All Ministries/ Department may use such lists prepared by other Ministries /
Departments as and when necessary. Registered suppliers are ordinarily exempted from
furnishing earnest money deposit/bid security with their tenders in tenders for items, and
Monetary Limits for which they are registered. The list of registered suppliers for the subject
matter of procurement be exhibited on the Central Public Procurement Portal and websites
of the Procuring Entity/ e-procurement/ portals.
3.4.4 Categories for Registration
In case of procurement of goods, the Administrative Department shall register firms as
suppliers of goods in different trade groups of goods in the following broad categories:
i)
Manufacturers, who supply indigenous items;
ii)
Agents/distributors of such manufacturers, who desire to market their production only
through their agents;
iii)
Foreign manufacturers with/without their accredited agent in India;
iv)
Stockists of imported spares or other specified items; and
v)
Suppliers of imported goods as are having regular arrangement with foreign
manufacturers.
3.4.5 One of the main prerequisites for registration as a manufacturer is that the firm
should possess its own in-house testing facilities. In case of MSE units, the firm need not
have its own testing facilities but regular arrangements with other reputed Government or
Government-approved or private agencies in its area for testing of products. Before the
manufacturer is included in the list of registered suppliers, Procuring Entity shall verify the
bona fides and standing of the firm. Procuring Entity may also seek assistance from the
inspection wing of other inspecting agencies. In case of firms having an established quality
maintenance system with ISO 9001- 2000 certification (latest version) by authorised
agencies, Procuring Entity may consider registration of such firms without carrying out
capacity assessment.
3.4.6

Grades (Monetary Limits) for Registration

Registration should be done by grading the firms (Grade A, B, and so on) on their capability
for executing contract orders of different monetary limits in the relevant category of

33

Amended vide DoE OM No. F.1/26/2018-PPD dated 02.04.2019.

42

requirements. The monetary limits should be carefully fixed keeping in view the banker's
reports, capacity and capability of the firm and other financial information indicated in the
balance sheets, profit and loss statements:
i)
Grade-A: Rs. 25 (Rupees twenty-five) lakh and above;
ii)
Grade B: Rupees five lakh to Rs.25(Rupees twenty-five) lakh; and
iii)
Grade C: Rupees One lakh and up to Rupees five lakh
3.4.7 The firms that are registered for supply of orders valued above Rupees five lakh
should invariably be manufacturers or their authorised agents. Procuring Entity shall register
the manufacturers and not agents or middlemen. A sole selling agent/authorised agent could
be considered for registration, subject to the condition that Procuring Entity is satisfied that
he is the sole selling agent of manufacturers, and financial and technical capabilities of the
manufacturers are ascertained by Procuring Entity. The availability of a suitable arrangement
with the sole selling agent for after-sales service shall also be ensured and Procuring Entity
shall also satisfy itself that a valid legal agreement exists between the applicant unit and its
sole selling agent, during the period for which he is registered.
3.4.8 Procedure for Registration: The procedure to be adopted in this regard by the
Central Purchase Organization or by any Ministry / Department in case it desires to register
suppliers of goods which are exclusively needed by it. Registration of suppliers should be
done ensuring fundamental principles of public procurement in view (especially the
transparency principle - transparency, fairness, equality, competition and appeal rights) with
the approval of CA after carefully assessing and verifying credentials, capability, quality
control systems, past performance, after-sales service facilities, financial background, and
so on, of the supplier/contractor/ service provider(s):
i)

Registration of the suppliers should be done following a fair, transparent and
reasonable procedure and after giving due publicity. Details of the procedure for
registration of new firms may be uploaded on the website and also published in the
form of a booklet for information of the suppliers. Timeframes and criteria for
registration of new suppliers may be clearly indicated;

ii)

Possible sources for any category/group of requirements can be identified based on
internal and external references. Data of new suppliers can be obtained from the
response received from suppliers, open tender advertisements, pre-qualification bids,
Expression of Interest (EoI), against various enquiries on the website, dedicated
websites, exhibitions, buyer-seller meets, various publications of NSIC ,
Development Commissioner of the Small Industries Service Institute, BIS, trade
journals, and so on. The e-procurement portal does pre-registration of suppliers
online. Such data can be a source of information on prospective suppliers;

iii)

New supplier(s) may be considered for registration at any time, provided they fulfil all
the required conditions. For any larger scale or critical registration or development of
new suppliers, Procuring Entity should call for EoI by publicising its need for
development of sources. The stages to be followed together with the applicable
guidelines for EoI have been detailed in Chapter 5;

iv)

While registering the firms, an undertaking may be obtained from them that they will
abide by the CIPP enclosed with the application with a clear warning that, in case of
transgression of the code of integrity, their names are likely to be deleted from the list

43

of registered suppliers, besides any other penalty or more severe action as deemed
fit; and
v)

Along with the new/renewal application for registration, the suppliers should also be
asked to declare that, if awarded a contract in any LTE in which they participate, they
bind themselves to abide by the Procuring Entity’s General Conditions of Contract
(GCC). Such GCC should be part of the application.

vi)

Eligibility
a) Any firm, situated in India or abroad, which is in the business of providing
goods/works/services of specified categories of interest, shall be eligible for
registration;
b) Where registration is granted based on partly outsourced arrangements/
agreements, it shall be the responsibility of the registered unit, to keep such
arrangements/agreements renewed/alive at all times, to keep their
registration valid for the period for which it has been granted. Any failure in
this regard may make the registration null and void ineffective retrospectively
from any such dates which the registering authority considers appropriate;
c) Suppliers should possess valid Digital Signature Certificate (DSCs) Class III
with the company name at the time of registration/ renewal, so as to enable
them to participate in e-procurements
d) Firm, against whom punitive action has been taken, shall not be eligible for
re-registration during the currency of punitive action. Registration requests
may not be entertained from such firms, stakeholders of whom have any
interest in deregistered/banned firms;
e) The application form, complete in all respects and accompanied with the
requisite processing fee and prescribed documents shall be submitted by the
firms to the registering authority. The registration application form, duly filledin, when received from the firms shall be scrutinised carefully for assessing
the capacity and capability of the firms including credentials, manufacturing
capability, quality control system, past performance, after-sales service
facilities, financial background, and so on, of the applicant. References shall
be made to other firms of standing of whom the applicant firm claims to be a
supplier/contractor. Likewise, the applicant firm’s bankers may also be
requested to advice about the financial standing of the firm. Registration of
suppliers should be done with the approval of CA.
f)

In cases where the firm is not considered capable and registration cannot be
granted, the concerned authority shall communicate the deficiencies and
shortcomings direct to the firms under intimation to the appellate authority.
Where a request for re- verification and review is made by the firm, along with
any fee as prescribed and within the period prescribed by the Department,
review shall be undertaken. Requests for re-verification after expiry of the
said period would be treated as a fresh application and processing fee, if any
prescribed, charged accordingly;

44

g) Registration should be for specific trade groups of goods/works/services. For
this purpose, all goods/ works/services should be divided into trade groups
and the information published on the relevant portals/ websites;
h) It should be mentioned in the letter of registration that the registration is valid
for a period of one to three years and would be considered for extension
based (on application by the supplier/contractor/service provider) on
satisfactory performance of the firm. However, the registration would be
initially treated as provisional and it would be treated as confirmed only after
the firm has satisfactorily executed one order of the relevant category and
value from Procuring Entity. The extension of validity of registration is not a
matter of right and Procuring Entity reserves the right not to extend such
registration without assigning any reason. New supplier(s) may also be
considered for registration at any time, provided they fulfil all the required
conditions;
i)

All registered suppliers should be allocated a unique registration number.
Once the firms are registered, a circular shall be issued by the registration
authority indicating the names and addresses of the registered suppliers with
details of the requirements and monetary value they will supply as well as the
validity period, and so on, for which they are registered. The list of registered
suppliers for the subject matter of procurement be exhibited on the Central
Public Procurement Portal and websites of the Procuring Entity/ eProcurement/ portals;

j)

Within the monetary limits so prescribed, as also for the category of
registration, the registered firm may be exempted from depositing the Earnest
Money Deposit (EMD). In other categories and higher monetary limits, the
supplier would be treated as any unregistered supplier and not be entitled to
the privileges of a registered supplier. The monetary limit or category, so laid
down, does not, however, debar a firm from getting orders in excess of the
monetary limit or for other categories, provided the Procuring Entity is
satisfied about the capacity and capability of the firm but a requisite security
deposit should be obtained, as is being done in the case of unregistered
firms;

k) Performance and conduct of every registered supplier is to be watched by the
concerned Department. Procuring Entity should also reserve the right to
remove firms who do not perform satisfactorily, even during the validity of
registration (after giving due opportunity to the supplier to make a
representation) if they fail to abide by the terms and conditions of the
registration or fail to execute contracts on time or supply substandard goods
or make any false declaration to any Government agency or for any ground
which, in the opinion of the Government, is not in public interest;
l)

Procuring Entity shall retain its option to reassess firms already registered, at
any later date, to satisfy itself about the current financial soundness/credit
worthiness, facilities available, and so on. Thereafter, Procuring Entity may
decide to retain them as registered suppliers for the requirements and
monetary limit earlier considered or with necessary changes as deemed fit. In
case of adverse reports from the team of Procuring Entity officers who

45

reassess the firm, Procuring Entity shall delete such firm from the registered
suppliers list;
(Rule 150 of GFR 2017)
3.4.9 Empanelment of contractors: Public authorities may empanel/ register contractors of
those specific goods and services which are required by them regularly. Performance of
such empanelled contractors should be reviewed periodically. The list of registered
contractors shall be updated on a regular basis. The category/ class of contractors may be
upgraded/ downgraded or contractors may be de-listed based on their performance.
Empanelment of contractors shall be done in a fair and equitable manner, preferably online
after giving due publicity.

3.5

Debarment of Suppliers

3.5.1 Registration of suppliers and their eligibility to participate in Procurement Entity’s
procurements is subject to compliance with Code of Integrity for Public Procurement and
good performance in contracts. Rule 151 of General Financial Rules (GFR), 2017 states the
following regarding the ‘Debarment from Bidding’:i.

A bidder shall be debarred if he has been convicted of an offence-

( a ) under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988; or
( b ) the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time being in force, for causing
any loss of life or property or causing a threat to public health as part of
execution of a public procurement contract.
ii.
A bidder debarred under sub-section (i) or any successor of the bidder shall not be
eligible to participate in a procurement process of any procuring entity for a period
not exceeding three years commencing from the date of debarment. Department of
Commerce (DGS&D) will maintain such list which will also be displayed on the
website of DGS&D as well as Central Public Procurement Portal.
iii.
A procuring entity may debar a bidder or any of its successors, from participating in
any procurement process undertaken by it, for a period not exceeding two years, if it
determines that the bidder has breached the code of integrity. The
Ministry/Department will maintain such list which will also be displayed on their
website.
iv.
The bidder shall not be debarred unless such bidder has been given a reasonable
opportunity to represent against such debarment
3.5.2 Since, DGS&D had been wind up on 31.10.2017, PPD, DoE did consultations on the
issue of Debarment with major procuring Ministries/ Departments and issued the following
‘Debarment Guidelines’ in suppression to all earlier instructions on this subject34.
3.5.3

Guidelines on Debarment of firms from Bidding

1.

The guidelines are classified under following two types:i)

34

In cases where debarment is proposed to be limited to a single Ministry, the
appropriate Orders can be issued by that Ministry itself, thereby banning all its
business dealing with the debarred firm.

Notified vide OM No. F.1/20/2018-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 02.11.2021

46

ii)

Where it is proposed to extend the debarment beyond the jurisdiction of the particular
Ministry i.e. covering to all central Ministries/ Departments, the requisite Orders shall
be issued by Department of Expenditure (DoE), Ministry of Finance (MoF).
Definitions
a)

Firm: The term 'firm' or 'bidder" has the same meaning for the purpose of these
Guidelines, which includes an individual or person, a company, a cooperative
society, a Hindu undivided family and an association or body of persons, whether
incorporated or not, engaged in trade or business.
b)
Allied firm: All concerns which come within the sphere of effective influence of the
debarred firms shall be treated as allied firms. In determining this, the following
factors may be taken into consideration:
1. Whether the management is common;
2. Majority interest in the management is held by the partners or directors of
banned/ suspended firm;
3. Substantial or majority shares are owned by the banned/ suspended firm and
by virtue of this it has a controlling voice.
4. Directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by or is under common control
with another bidder.
5. All successor firms will also be considered as allied firms.
The terms “banning of firm”, ‘suspension’, ‘Black-Listing’ etc. convey the same meaning as
of “Debarment".
2.

Debarment by a Single Ministry/ Department

Orders for Debarment of a firm(s) shall be passed by a Ministry/ Department/organizations,
keeping in view of the following:
i)
ii)

iii)

iv)

v)

vi)
vii)

A bidder or any of its successors may be debarred from participating in any
procurement process for a period not exceeding two years.
Firms will be debarred if it is determined that the bidder has breached the code of
integrity as per Rule 175 of GFRs 2017. (Refer to para 3.2 of this Manual for further
reading on Code of Integrity).
A bidder can also be debarred for any actions or omissions by the bidder other than
violation of code of integrity, which in the opinion of the Ministry/Department,
warrants debarment, for the reasons like supply of sub-standard material, non-supply
of material, abandonment of works, sub-standard quality of works, failure to abide
“Bid Securing Declaration” etc.
It shall not be circulated to other Ministries/ Departments. It will only be applicable to
all the attached/ subordinate offices, Autonomous bodies, Central Public Sector
Undertakings (CPSUs) etc. of the Ministry/ Department issuing the debarment Order.
The concerned Ministry/ Department before issuing the debarment order against a
firm must ensure that reasonable opportunity has been given to the concerned firm to
represent against such debarment (including personal hearing, if requested by firm).
Secretary of Ministry/Department may nominate an officer at the rank of Joint
Secretary/Additional Secretary as competent authority to debar the firms.
Ministry/ Department that issued the order of debarment can also issue an Order for
revocation of debarment before the period of debarment is over, if there is adequate
justification for the same. Ordinarily, the revocation of the Order before expiry of

47

debarred period should be done with the approval of Secretary concerned of
Ministry/Department.
viii)
The Ministry/Department will maintain list of debarred firms, which will also be
displayed on its website.
ix)
Debarment is an executive function and should not be allocated to Vigilance
Department.
3.
It is possible that the firm may be debarred concurrently by more than one Ministry/
Department. Ministries/ Departments at their option may also delegate powers to debar
bidders to their CPSUs, Attached Offices/ Autonomous Bodies etc. In such cases, broad
principles for debarment in para 2 as above are to be kept in mind. Debarment by such
bodies like CPSUs etc. shall be applicable only for the procurements made by such bodies.
Similarly, Government e-Marketplace (GeM) can also debar bidders up to two years on its
portal. In case of debarments done by CPSUs, revocation of the debarment orders before
expiry of debarred period should be done only with the approval of Chief Executive Officer of
concerned CPSUs etc.
4.

Debarment across All Ministries/ Departments

vi)
5.

Where a Ministry/ Department is of the view that business dealings with a particular
firm should be banned across all the Ministries/ Departments by debarring the firm
from taking part in any bidding procedure floated by the Central Government
Ministries/ Departments, the Ministry/ Department concerned, should after obtaining
the approval of the Secretary concerned, forward to DoE a self-contained note
setting out all the facts of the case and the justification for the proposed debarment,
along with all the relevant papers and documents. DoE will issue the necessary
orders after satisfying itself that proposed debarment across all the Ministries/
Departments is in accordance with Rule 151 of GFRs, 2017. This scrutiny is intended
to ensure uniformity of treatment in all cases.
The firm will remain in suspension mode (i.e. debarred) during the interim period till
the final decision taken by DoE, only in the Ministry/ Department forwarding such
proposal.
Ministry/ Department before forwarding the proposal to DoE must ensure that
reasonable opportunity has been given to the concerned firm to represent against
such debarment (including personal hearing, if requested by firm). If DoE realizes
that sufficient opportunity has not be given to the firm to represent against the
debarment, such debarment requests received from Ministries/ Departments shall be
rejected.
DoE can also give additional opportunity, at their option, to firm to represent against
proposed debarment. DoE can also take suo-moto action to debar the firms in certain
circumstances.
No contract of any kind whatsoever shall be placed on the debarred firm, including its
allied firms by any Ministries/ Departments/ Attached/Subordinate offices of the
Government of India including autonomous body, CPSUs etc. after the issue of a
debarment order.
DoE will maintain list of such debarred firms, which will be displayed on Central
Public Procurement Portal.

An order for debarment passed shall be deemed to have been automatically revoked
on the expiry of that specified period and it will not be necessary to issue a specific
formal order of revocation.
A debarment order may be revoked before the expiry of the Order, by the competent
authority, if it is of the opinion that the disability already suffered is adequate in the
circumstances of the case or for any other reason.
Other Provisions (common to both types of debarment)
No contract of any kind whatsoever shall be placed to debarred firm including its
allied firms after the issue of a debarment order by the Ministry/ Department. Bids
from only such firms shall be considered for placement of contract, which are neither
debarred on the date of opening of tender (first bid, normally called as technical bid,
in case of two packet/two stage bidding) nor debarred on the date of contract. Even
in the cases of risk purchase, no contract should be placed on such debarred firms.
If case, any debar firms has submitted the bid, the same will be ignored. In case such
firm is lowest (L-1), next lowest firm shall be considered as L-1. Bid security
submitted by such debarred firms shall be returned to them.
Contracts concluded before the issue of the debarment order shall, not be affected
by the debarment Orders.
The Debarment shall be automatically extended to all its allied firms. In case of joint
venture/ consortium is debarred all partners will also stand debarred for the period
specified in Debarment Order. The names of partners should be clearly specified in
the “Debarment Order”.
Debarment in any manner does not impact any other contractual or other legal rights
of the procuring entities.
The period of debarment shall start from the date of issue of debarment order.
The Order of debarment will indicate the reason(s) in brief that lead to debarment of
the firm.
Ordinarily, the period of debarment should not be less than six months.
In case of shortage of suppliers in a particular group, such debarments may also hurt
the interest of procuring entities. In such cases, endeavour should be to
pragmatically analyze the circumstances, try to reform the supplier and may get a
written commitment from the supplier that its performance will improve.
All Ministries/ Departments must align their existing Debarment Guidelines in
conformity with these Guidelines. Further, bidding documents must also be suitably
amended, if required.

3.5.4 Safeguarding Procuring Entity’s Interests during debarment of suppliers:
Suppliers are important assets for the procuring entities and punishing delinquent suppliers
should be the last resort. It takes lot of time and effort to develop, register and mature a new
supplier. In case of shortage of suppliers in a particular group of materials/equipment, such
punishment may also hurt the interest of Procuring Entity. Therefore, views of the concerned
Department may always be sought about the repercussions of such punitive action on the
continuity of procurements. Past records of performance of the supplier may also be given
due weightage. In case of shortage of suppliers and in cases of less serious
misdemeanours, the endeavour should be to pragmatically analyse the circumstances,
reform the supplier and get a written commitment from the supplier that his performance will
improve. If this fails, efforts should be to see if a temporary debarment can serve the
purpose.

Ministries/ Departments if they so require, may enlist Indian agents, who desire to quote
directly on behalf of their foreign principals35. (Rule 152 of GFR 2017)

Chapter 4: Modes of Procurement and Bidding Systems
4.1

Modes of Procurement

Offers from prospective bidders in public procurement must be invited according to a
procedure that achieves a balance between the need for the widest competition, on one
hand, and complexity of the procedure, on the other hand. Different modes of procurement
and bidding systems are used to suit various procurement circumstances to achieve this
balance. There are laid down procedures for delegation of powers of procurement to various
competent authorities under different modes as shown in DPFR. Each procuring entity may
also publish its own Schedule of Procurement Powers (SoPP) delegating such powers within
the entity.
However, as mentioned in Para 1.3 (Applicability of this Manual), for procurements financed
by Loans/Grants extended by International Agencies, like the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank etc., the procurement procedures, as finalized and incorporated in the
Articles of Agreements with such agencies for relevant Loans/ grants after consideration and
approval of the Ministry of Finance are to be followed.
The various modes of procurement that can be used in public procurement are:

1) Open Tenders
a) Open Tender Enquiry (OTE); and
b) Global Tender Enquiry (GTE)

2) Procurement through Selected Suppliers
a) Limited Tender Enquiry - LTE (up to Rs. 25 (Rupees twenty-five) lakh); and
b) Special Limited Tender Enquiry (SLTE above Rs. 25 (Rupees twenty-five) lakh
under special circumstances)

3) Nomination Basis Tenders
a) Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC); and
b) Single Tender Enquiry (STE) without PAC

4) Procurements without Calling Tenders
a) Direct Procurement without Quotation;
b) Direct Procurement by Purchase Committee;

5) Mandatory Procurement of Goods and Services for Goods or Services available on
GeM
(Rule 158 of GFR 2017)

4.2

Open Tender Enquiry(OTE)

4.2.1 In OTE, an attempt is made to attract the widest possible competition by publishing
the NIT simultaneously on the designated websites. This is the default mode of procurement
and gives the best value for money but the procedure is relatively complex and prolonged.
The systemic cost of this procedure may be high enough to be unviable for smaller value

51

procurements. OTE procedures through e-procurement or through traditional tendering
should be adopted in the following situations:
i)

Procurements exceeding the threshold of Rs. 25 lakh (Rupees Twenty Five Lakh);

ii)

All common use requirements with clear technical specifications;

iii)

For requirements that are ordinarily available in the open market but it is necessary
to evaluate competitive offers to decide the most suitable and economical option
available; and

iv)

When requirements are not available from known sources or sources are presently
limited and need to be broad based. In such situations, even for procurements below
Rs. 25 (Rupees twenty-five) lakh, OTE mode may be used, if warranted.
(Rule 161 of GFR 2017)
4.2.2

Terms and Conditions

i)

Bidders already registered are also free to participate;

ii)

Advertisement in such cases should be given on Central Public Procurement Portal
(CPPP) at www.eprocure.gov.in and on GeM. An organisation having its own web
site should also publish all its advertised tender enquiries on the web site. The
procuring entity should also post the complete bidding document in its web site and
on CPPP to enable prospective bidders to make use of the document by
downloading from the web site. The advertisements for invitation of tenders should
give the complete web address from where the bidding documents can be
downloaded. In order to promote wider participation and ease of bidding, no cost of
tender document may be charged for the tender documents downloaded by the
bidders.; and

iii)

The sale/ availability for downloading of tender documents against NIT should not be
restricted and should be available freely. Tender documents should preferably be
sold/ available for download up to the date of opening of tenders.

iv)

The tender documents should be prepared on the basis of the relevant approved
SBD for the category of procurement. Further details on preparing tender documents
are provided in Chapter 6.

v)

The procuring entity shall maintain proper records about the number of tender
documents sold, list of parties to whom sold, details of the amount received through
sale and, also, the number of unsold tender documents, which are to be cancelled
after the opening of the tenders.

4.2.3

OTE - Risks and Mitigations

Risk

Mitigation

Since the crux of this mode of
procurement is attracting bids from
all possible prospective bidders.
The risk is that this may not be
achieved, even after incurring
extra cost of open tendering. This

It should be ensured that the NIT on the website is
easily searchable and visible, not hidden under layers
of clicks. The matter should not be left entirely to the
website or media publicity alone. Due diligence should
be done to locate likely bidders (including past bidders)
and their attention should be drawn though
SMS/mail/email. All registered vendors/contractors (in

52

4.2.3

OTE - Risks and Mitigations

Risk

Mitigation

could be due to

particular past successful vendors/contractors) should
be given intimation about forthcoming tenders via
SMS/mail/ email.

•
•

Insufficient publicity;
Hindrances in availability of bid
documents;
insufficient
time
for
bid
preparation; or
Due to onerous cost of biddocuments or EMD

•
•

Further a limited or open tender which results in only
one effective offer shall be treated as a single tender
enquiry situation, with relevant powers of approval etc.
It should be also ensured that there is no impediment
to issue/access of bid documents.
The due date fixed for opening of the tender shall be
minimum21 (twenty-one) days from the date of
advertisement which may vary, taking into account the
nature of material called for and delivery requirements.
The due date may be subsequently extended with the
approval of the CA, only if it is felt necessary to have
better competition.
The tender documents, shall be priced minimally (if at
all priced, refer Para 5.2.1
Cost and Availability of
Tender Documents) keeping in view the value of the
tender as also the cost of preparation and publicity of
the tender documents.
EMD should be sufficient to ensure that bidders honour
their bids but at the same time should not be large
enough to reduce competition.

Lack of clarity in description/
specification of requirement or
undue stringency in qualifying
criteria or other conditions

4.3

Mitigations of such risks can be addressed at the time
of need assessment and procurement planning (please
refer to Chapter 2), so as to attract adequate
competition.

Global Tender Enquiry(GTE)

4.3.1 GTE is similar to OTE but, through appropriate advertising and provision for payment
in Foreign Currencies through Letter of Credit, it is aimed at inviting the participation of interalia foreign firms. The point of balance between VfM and cost/ complexity of procedure is
further aggravated as compared to OTE. Development of local industry also needs to be
kept in mind. Hence, it may be viable only in following situations:
i)

Where Goods of required specifications/quality are not available within the country
and alternatives available in the country are not suitable for the purpose;

ii)

Non-existence of a local branch of the global principal of the manufacturer/vendors/
contractors;

iii)

Requirement for compliance to specific international standards in technical
specifications; and

53

iv)

Absence of a sufficient number of competent domestic bidders likely to comply with
the required technical specifications, and in case of suspected cartel formation
among indigenous bidders.

Rupees or US Dollars or Euros or Pound Sterling or Yen or in currencies under the
Reserve Bank of India’s notified basket of currencies;

called for as well as the time required to prepare the bids. The due date may be
subsequently extended with the approval of the CA only to promote better
competition and also considering account delivery requirement; and
Relevant INCOTERMS should be included in the tender.

4.3.3 No Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) up to Rs. 200 crores36 shall be invited or such
limit as may be prescribed by the Department of Expenditure from time to time. In
exceptional cases where the Ministry or Department feels that there are special reasons for
inviting GTE, for tenders below such limit, it may record its detailed justification and seek
prior approval for relaxation from the Competent Authority specified by the Department of
Expenditure.
a) The proposal for approval shall be submitted by Administrative Ministry with the
concurrence of Financial Advisor and approval of Secretary concerned. The

developed for this purpose) so that those can be utilized by the needy institutes.
d) Without compromising quality, Institutes should indicate alternative/ equivalent
technical specifications that could suit their requirement, so that there are more
chances of local manufacturers participate in the tendering process.
e) Regular interaction between academia and Indian industry organizations at the level
of the institution about the requirement of equipment of foreign origin and for
encouraging the domestic manufacturing.
f) Regular requirement of proprietary/ non-proprietary research consumables may be
assessed and domestic alternatives are explored for use.

4.3.6.2 Guidelines for resorting to GTE
a) Market assessment should be done by the concerned institution, as certified by the
Head of the Institution. Only after no Indian manufacturer is found, a GTE should be
issued.
b) In case no Indian manufacturer/ suppliers are found, procurement may be done,
through GTE, subject to compliance of provisions of GFR and requirement of
procurement through GeM.
c) DEAN (R&D) or an appropriate authority within the institute will issue certificates as
per para 4.3.6.3 below, before inviting GTE. As a reporting matter in the Board of
Governors, such certificates should be tabled, and also shared with Office of the
PSA, DPIIT and concerned Administrative Ministry.
d) The information about the procurement of equipment should be shared across
various Educational and Research Institutes, through the I-STEM portal, already
established for this purpose by the PSA’s office. This will allow the equipment to be
used by other institutions too, for research purposes.
e) Analyze the equipment being procured time and again from abroad, and help
developing them in India by identifying potential manufacturers and providing them
technical assistance and expertise for developing the equipment. Half yearly reports
on this action to be shared by the Institutes with the Office of the PSA, DPIIT and
concerned Administrative Ministry/ A national level scheme will also be initiated by
the Office of PSA for indigenous development of scientific equipment.
f) Preference to local suppliers over foreign supplier as per the existing Government of
India guidelines, should be observed as applicable.
4.3.6.3 Certificates to be issued
a) Confirmation of non-availability in India of particular equipment/ consumables of
foreign origin through GeM and other sources.
b) Certification that locally available alternatives with equivalent specifications are not
suitable for research purposes.
c) The non-availability of such equipment for research purposes with nearby research
institutes or within the institute.
d) Certification of the requirement of proprietary items of foreign origin for research
purposes (where applicable).

to/by the agents should be explicit and transparent in
the bids/contracts

4.4

Limited Tender Enquiry(LTE)

4.4.1 LTE is a restricted competition procurement, where a preselected list of vendors is
directly approached for bidding; bids from uninvited bidders are treated as unsolicited and
are normally not entertained, except in special circumstances. This mode provides a short
and simple procedure, but may not provide as good a VfM as in case of open tendering –
still a good balance for procurements below a threshold. LTE procedures should be default
mode of procurement when the estimated value of procurement is between Rs. 2.5lakh to
Rs. 25 lakh (Rupees two and a half Lakh to Twenty-five Lakh). The bidding documents
should be simple normally consisting a single page with terms and conditions printed
overleaf.
(Rule 162 of GFR 2017)
4.4.2

Terms and Conditions

i)

Copies of the bidding documents should be sent free of cost (except in case of priced
specifications/ drawings) directly by speed post/courier/e-mail to firms which are
registered vendors/ contractors. Further, Procuring Entity should also mandatorily
publish its limited tender enquiries on Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP).
Apart from CPPP, the organisations should publish the tender enquiries on the
Department’s or Ministry’s web site.

ii)

A simplified single Page Bid Document (Annexure 5) should be used, instead of a
detailed Bid Document. The minimum number of bidders to whom LTE should be
sent is more than three. In case less than three approved vendors/contractors are
available, LTE may be sent to the available approved vendors/contractors with
approval of the CA, duly recording the reasons. The requirement should then be
marked for development of more sources by the Supplier Registration section.

LTE repeatedly. Audit should take up a
larger percentage of cases in LTE for review.

There is a risk that LTE may not attract
sufficient number of bids and sometimes
there may be a single acceptable offer. This
may be because of an insufficient database
of registered/known vendors. It could also be
due to bid documents not reaching the
targeted bidders – intentionally or otherwise.
It could also be due to bidders not getting
adequate time for submission of bids. On the
other hand, unsolicited bidders may also
quote – causing a transparency dilemma
about consideration of such offers.

Maintenance of list of registered suppliers is
a sine-qua-non for LTE. The List of
registered vendors needs to be reviewed
perpetually to ensure adequate number of
qualified suppliers To ensure sufficient
response, in addition to mails/emails to
selected vendors, web-based publicity
should be given for limited tenders, with
suitable clarifications that unsolicited bids
shall not be considered. Further a limited or
open tender which results in only one
effective offer shall be treated as a single
tender enquiry situation, with relevant
powers of approval etc.
Adequate time should be given for
submission of quotes, which should not be
less than three weeks. A longer period (six
weeks) could be given in case of import of
the materials and, in complex cases, if
justifications are given and allowed.

There is also a risk that the selection of
vendors may not be transparent. At the
evaluation stage, some invited bidders may
be passed over on grounds of being
ineligible/unreliable.

All major procuring Departments must keep
a list of registered bidders for use in
restricted bidding. Suppliers or contractors
should be selected in a non-discriminatory
manner. All past successful vendors/bidders
should invariably be invited. In case it is
proposed
to
exclude
any
registered/approved vendor/ contractor from
being shortlisted for inviting LTE, detailed
reasons, such as failure in supply, should be
duly recorded and approval of the CA be
taken before exclusion. The selection of
bidders should be with due diligence, to
ensure that bidders who do not meet
eligibility criteria do not get shortlisted. At the
evaluation stage, in LTE, passing over of a
duly shortlisted bidder on grounds of poor
past performance or eligibility may raise
questions about transparency.

Special Limited Tender Enquiry for Procurements More than Rs. 25
(Rupees twenty-five) Lakh
4.5.1 LTE mode, even for values higher than Rs. 25lakh (Rupees Twenty-five Lakh) (Rule
162 of GFR 2017), where normally OTE should have been done, is permissible in certain
special circumstances as follows. Powers to sanction procurement on LTE basis in such
special cases may be laid down in SoPP based on a certificate of urgency signed by the
indenter. This mode has the merit of being quicker but VfM obtained may be less than in
case of OTE; hence it should be restricted to rare situations:
i)

The competent authority in the Ministry / Department certifies that there is an existing
or prospective urgency for operational or technical requirements and any additional
expenditure involved by not procuring through advertised tender enquiry is justified in
view of urgency. The Ministry/Department should also put on record the nature of the
urgency and reasons why the procurement could not be anticipated earlier.

ii)

There are sufficient reasons, to be recorded in writing by the competent authority,
indicating that it will not be in public interest to procure the goods through advertised
tender enquiry.

iii)

The sources of supply are definitely known and possibility of fresh source(s) beyond
those being tapped is remote.

iv)

Nature of items to be procured is such that pre-verification of competence of firm is
essential, hence requires registration of firms.; and

v)

Government policy designates procurement from specific agencies.

4.5.2

Terms and Conditions

i)

The tendering process would be same as in the case of a normal LTE described
above. However, the bidding documents are more detailed as in the case of OTE;
and

ii)

The indenter should certify that there is an existing or prospective urgency for
operational or technical requirements and any additional expenditure involved by not
procuring through an advertised tender enquiry is justified in view of urgency. The
indenter should also put on record the nature of the urgency and reasons why the
procurement could not be anticipated.

Risks as applicable in both LTE and OTE are
also applicable here. In addition there is a
risk that this mode may be used unjustifiably
to avoid open tendering (OTE).

All mitigation strategies of LTE and OTE
would apply here also. In addition the
systems of checks and balances should be
tighter by way of enhanced and severely
restricted delegation of powers in this regard
for certification of urgency and approval of
this mode of procurement. A system of

Proprietary Article Certificate

4.6.1 In procurement of goods, certain items are procured only from Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEMs) or manufacturers having proprietary rights (or their authorised
dealers/stockists) against a PAC certificate (Annexure 6) signed by the appropriate authority.
Once a PAC is signed at the designated level as per SoPP, the powers of procurement are
the same as in normal conditions as per the delegation of powers. This mode may be
shortest but since it may provide lesser VfM as compared to LTE/OTE and also strains the
transparency principle, it should be used only in justifiable situations.
(Rule 166 of GFR 2017)
4.6.2

Terms and Conditions

i)

Users should enclose, with their Indent, a PAC certificate indicating the justification
and approval at the appropriate level as per DPFR/ SoPP, for sourcing an item from
OEM or PAC firms or their authorised agents;

ii)

Proprietary items shall be purchased only from a nominated manufacturer or its
authorised dealer as recorded in the PAC certificate;

iii)

In certain unavoidable cases, the procuring authority may have no alternative but to
waive payment of EMD/SD for procurement on a proprietary basis;

iv)

To the extent feasible, the firm may be asked to certify that the rates quoted by them
are the same and not higher than those quoted with other Government, public sector
or private organisations;

4.7

Single Tender Enquiry (STE) without a PAC

4.7.1 A tender invitation to one firm only without a PAC certificate is called a single tender.
This mode may be shortest but since it may provide lesser VfM as compared to LTE/OTE
and may also strain the transparency principle, it should be resorted to only under following
conditions:
i)

In a case of existing or prospective emergency relating to operational or technical
requirements to be certified by the indenter, the required goods are necessarily to be
purchased from a particular source subject to the reason for such decision being
recorded and approval of the competent authority obtained.

ii)

For standardization of machinery or components or spare parts to be compatible to
the existing sets of machinery/equipment (on the advice of a competent technical
expert and approved by the competent authority), the required goods are to be
purchased only from a selected firm.

(Rule 166 of GFR 2017)
4.7.2

Terms and Conditions

i)

The reasons for a STE and selection of a particular firm must be recorded and
approved by the CA as per the delegation of powers laid down at in DPFR/SoPP,
prior to single tendering. Unlike in PAC, powers of procurement of STE are more
restricted; and

ii)

Other terms and conditions of PAC procurement mentioned above would also apply
in this case.

iii)

All works/purchase/ consultancy contracts awarded on nomination basis should be
brought to the notice of following authorities for information(a) The Secretary, in case of ministries/departments.

2. The audit committee or similar unit in the organisation may be required to
check at least 10% of such cases.
4.7.3

STE - Risks and Mitigations

Risk
Same but more heightened risks than PAC
are present in this mode. Selection ofa

PAC should apply. Procurements on a STE
basis should be made from reputed firms
after determining reasonableness of rates.
Powers of procurement of STE should be
severely restricted.

Drawals against Rate Contract (RC)/Framework Contract (FC)
a) 4.8.1 RC is essentially a price agreement with the vendors/contractors at a
specified price and terms and conditions during the period covered by the RC. No
quantity is mentioned nor is any minimum commitment guaranteed in the RC. RC is
most frequently used in procurement of goods, but can as well be used mutadis
mutandis in works, services and consultancy – where it is commonly known as a
Framework Contract (FC). For appropriate items (please see para 4.8.3 below),
drawals against an existing RC exploits the power of collaboration/ clubbing of
numerous small and frequent requirements and thus provides best VfM along with a
simple and quick procedure. However, entering into a new RC may have the same
procedural complexity, prolonged timeframe and systemic cost as in OTE, which may
not be viable for low volumes. In view of Government e Marketplace (please see para
4.17 below) coming into operation, Rate Contract is not required to be executed for
common use items like computers, printers, photocopiers, paper and stationary,
other office items like furniture, bottled water etc., which are being placed on GeM
and will now be applicable only for specialized and engineering items which are not
available on GeM, and are identified as common use items and are needed on
recurring basis by various Central Government Ministries or Departments..

Rate Contracts - Risks and Mitigations
Mitigation

63

4.8.2

Rate Contracts - Risks and Mitigations

Risk
Rate contract is not a right mode of
procurement for critical, strategic and vital
requirements, since the buyer – seller
relationships is tripartite and the timely
supply of requirements and penalties thereof
can be so strictly enforced as in other modes
of procurements. Moreover the RC holder is
more beholden to the Central Purchase
Organisation than to end-customer.

Mitigation
RCs may be avoided for critical/ strategic
and vital requirements. Central Purchase
Organisation
may
also
tighten
up
enforcement of delivery performance and
penalties thereof.
For seasonal and short-supply items CPO
may monitor and provide clauses to prevent
dumping and starving of supplies.

entity at wrong seasons and starve them in
working seasons. This happens in say
Cement, when Government Buyers are likely
to be saddled with huge supplies during rainy
season, but RC holders may divert bulk of
supplies to private market in working season.
RC Purchase is not suitable for requirements
of dynamic Technological and price changes
e.g. PCs, Laptops, Tablets, Servers, Mobile
Phones – where the price of older models
may crash as soon as a model is
announced. RC holders may slow down
supplies initially, but dump supplier when
prices crash in the market.
The existence of RCs may not be adequately
made known to possible users. Moreover,
the reverse risk is that many different offices
may keep procuring the same item
independently, thus missing the potential
benefits of bulk prices and simplified
processes if such items were brought under
an RC

The descriptions, specifications and other
salient details of all RC appropriately
updated, should be available on the website
of DGS&D and Procuring Entity as well as
the
e-Procurement
portal.
The
eprocurement system should be able to offer
alerts about availability of RC, if an attempt is
made to float a tender for the same item. To
derive benefit from bulk prices in RC, all
offices should furnish to the RC agency, their
annual requirement of items to enable
finalising of RCs after inviting quotations.
DGS&D may also extract information from eprocurement portals.

64

4.8.2

Rate Contracts - Risks and Mitigations

Risk
RC procurements are at risk of being
ordered in excess of actual requirements,
since the procurement scrutiny may not be
as intense as in case of other modes of
procurements.

Mitigation
The quantity being ordered should be subject
to the same level of scrutiny as in other
modes of procurement to ensure that there is
no abnormal unexplainable trend in
procurement.

Wherever there are parallel RCs for the
same item from a number of firms, there may
be intense and often unhealthy lobbying
(including corrupt practices) from them to
seek orders.

Departments must put in place adequate
guidelines to handle RC procurements,
including a transparent system of choosing
the RC holders by rotation in a transparent
manner in case of parallel RCs. The
delegation of powers in this regard should
also be restricted keeping these risks in
view. A suggest guidelines is given below:
1
For selecting the DGS&D Rate
contract holders for ordering, following
factors may be kept in view:
(i)

The Rate Contract Price;

(ii)
The past performance of firm with
reference to their capacity, quality of supplies
as well as timely delivery of the goods;
(iii)
The delivery date committed by the
firm with respect to the deli very requirement
of the Procuring Entity;
(iv)
The proximity of the rate contract
holder wherever the proximity is considered
crucial for timely deli very, ease of
progressing and from the point of view of
logistics and contract management etc.; and
(v)
The need for reputed brands in the
case of sensitive, critical and selective
applications.
(vi)
In case of number of firms meeting
such criteria, orders may be split or rotated in
a transparent manner.
2.
The Procuring Entity should maintain
suitable records of RC firms for past
performance in respect of timely delivery and
quality.
3.
Wherever, there are failures against
the rate contract in terms of timely deli very

and quality of goods, such failures should be
reported to DGS&D and direct alternate
procurement action may be taken in order to
ensure timely availability of quality materials
to meet the needs of the Procuring Entity.

Direct Procurement without Quotation

4.9.1 Direct procurement of goods without formal quotations is normally done for the
smallest value procurements. This is also called petty purchase. It should be used for offthe-shelf goods of simple and standard specifications and when the required goods (of
required specification or within required delivery period etc.) are not available on GeM46.
However, it is mandatory for a buyer to generate a “GeM Availability Report and Past
Transaction Summary” (GeMAR&PTS) 47 with a unique ID on GeM portal using his login
credentials on GeM for procurement outside GeM. The procedure is the simplest and
quickest but VfM may be poor; hence it is suitable only in very low value, urgent and simple
requirements in the following situations:
i)

Procurements do not exceed the threshold (for each requirement) of Rs. 25,000
(Rupees Twenty-five Thousand) for each case;

ii)

The requirement is urgent but was not covered in the procurement plan; and

iii)

The requirement is for off-the-shelf goods of simple and standard specifications.
Examples of procurement are day-to-day needs of the office and field units, and so
on.

Terms and Conditions
The competent officer of the procuring entity can initiate and complete this purchase
after diligent enquiries from the market and filling the certificate prescribed (Annexure
7). Such powers to a limited extent can also be given to various user sections for
operational needs.
Normally an imprest amount (with facilities for cheque payments) sufficient for two
months’ estimated procurements can be sanctioned for such officers to handle such
procurements. The imprest amount can be recouped on monthly basis by submission
of expense vouchers.
In a summary form, records should be kept of the vendors/contractors approached
and prices indicated by them.

Direct Procurement without Quotations - Risks and Mitigations

Risk
The main risk is splitting of demand to avoid
higher approvals or higher modes of
procurements.

Mitigation
Supervisors should carry out periodic review
of such procurements to ensure that the
demand is not split into small quantities for
the sole purpose of avoiding the necessity of
getting an approval from the higher authority
required for sanctioning the purchase of the
original demand or for avoiding LTE or OTE
mode of procurement. An annual review of
such procurements shall be carried out to
ensure that future anticipated requirements
are clubbed and procured through LTE/
OTE/ RC.

To keep a better control, an annual ceiling
may be fixed for each office for such a mode
of procurement say Rupees five Lakh for
each office per year Each office should
maintain records to monitor such limits
Over a period of time intentionally or
otherwise, the due diligence of enquiries
from market may degenerate into a
mechanical obtaining of quotations, leading
to development of nexus and crony
suppliers. Vendor selection may actually be
manipulated with fake supporting vouchers.
Since such small value materials do not
undergo accounting and inventory control,
the risk of development of a nexus, leakages
and fake procurements and payments are
there. The same set of vendors may get
patronised repeatedly for a wide variety of
requirements. Since only cursory visual
inspections are done, quality may be at risk.

4.10

Supervisors
should
cross
check
a
percentage of cases in the market for prices,
fake vouchers, and so on. Supervisors
should also check that the same vendor(s) is
not being patronised repeatedly. For the
sake of transparency, payments should be
made by cheque or through Electronic
Clearance Service except that cash payment
may be allowed up to Rs. 5,000 (Rupees
Five thousand). Staff involved with such
procurements should not continue in the
same role for long and should be rotated
frequently.

Direct Procurement by Purchase Committee

4.10.1 This mode of procurement is used for procurements valued above Rs. 25,000/(Rupees Twenty-five Thousand) and upto Rs. 2,50,000 (Rupees Two Lakh Fifty Thousand)
only on each occasion. It is made by a local purchase committee constituted by HOD only in

67

case when a certain item is not available on the GeM portal (of required specification or
within required delivery period etc.)48. However, it is mandatory for a buyer to generate a
“GeM Availability Report and Past Transaction Summary” (GeMAR&PTS)49 with a unique ID
on GeM portal using his login credentials on GeM for procurement outside GeM. This mode
of procurement is described in parlance of procurement of goods; however, in principle, it is
equally applicable to contingency expenditure on small works/services also. This procedure
is slightly more complex and is likely to provide better VfM than direct procurement without
quotation and hence is suitable for marginally higher thresholds
(Rule 155 of GFR 2017)
4.10.2 Terms and Conditions
i)

The controlling ministry may lay down an annual ceiling value per office/unit for such
procurements;

ii)

In case of emergency procurement, facility of withdrawing requisite advance cash
amount and its subsequent accountal may also be considered.

iii)

This is intended to be fast track, simple mode of procurement. The committee will
survey the market to ascertain the reasonableness of rate, quality and specifications
and identify the appropriate supplier.

iv)

Selection of suitable product and supplier by actual market survey (not by calling of
tenders like a mini LTE) is of essence of this mode.

v)

Before recommending placement of the purchase order, members of the committee
will jointly record the certificate prescribed (Annexure 8); and

vi)

In larger cities, the presence of reputed Shopping Malls may also be included in the
market survey. Reputed internet shopping portals may also be explored.

4.10.3 Direct Procurement by Purchase Committee - Risks and Mitigations
Risk
Risks are the same as in the case of direct
procurement without quotation mentioned
above, with mitigation due to involvement of
three members. Over a period of time

There is also a risk of delays in finalisation of
contract by the Procuring Entity, which may
not be responsive to indenting organisations
urgencies, especially if procurement involves
clubbing of Indents from a number of
organisations.

To mitigate such risk liaison may be
maintained with the Procuring Entity. In case
abnormal delay is taking place, small
procurement to tide over urgencies may be
made directly.

Another risk is that the Supplier may not feel
answerable to the Indenter and may not be
responsive towards delivery, quality and after
sales support. If problems arise, it may
require a dilatory tripartite correspondence.

To mitigate this, proper commercial clauses
may be included in the Indent to ensure
responsiveness of supplier to the Indentor.
Liaison with Procuring Organisation would
also mitigate such risks.

Bidding Systems

Bidding systems are designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the countervailing
needs for Right Quality, Right Source and the Right Price under different complexities/
criticality of Technical requirements and value of procurements. In certain critical and
complex requirements, the technical and financial capability of Source of supply becomes an
important determinant for value for money. Depending on the complexity and criticality
Technical of requirement, Criticality of capability of Source and value of procurement,
following types of bidding systems may be used.

69

4.13

Single Stage Bidding System

In single stage bidding, all bids are invited together in a single envelope or in multiple
envelops system. This bidding system is suitable where technical requirement are simple or
moderate; capability of source of supply is not too crucial and the value of procurement is
not too high;
4.13.1 Single Stage Single Envelop System: Where qualitative requirements and
technical specifications are clear; capability of source of supply isn’t critical and value of
procurement is low or moderate, the single envelop system, where eligibility,
technical/commercial and financial details are submitted together in the same envelop may
be followed. This is the simplest and the quickest bidding system and should be the default
system of bidding. The lowest responsive priced bid that meets the eligibility criteria,
technical and commercial requirements laid down in the bid documents is declared as
successful.
4.13.2 Single Stage Two Envelops System (Two Bid System) (Rule 163 of GFR
2017):In technically complex requirements but where capability of source of supply is still not
crucial and value of procurement is not low, a two envelop system may to be followed.
i)

The tenderers should be asked to bifurcate their quotations in two envelops. The first
envelop, called the techno-commercial bid, contains the eligibility, technical quality
and performance aspects, commercial terms and conditions and documents sought
in the tender, except the price and relevant financial details. In the second envelop,
called the financial bid, the price quotation along with other financial details are
submitted. Both the envelops are to be submitted together in a sealed outer
envelope;

ii)

If required, Technical specification and techno-commercial conditions should be
modified, in a pre-bid conference in the two envelop tender and it would be desirable
not to invite fresh financial bids after opening of the techno-commercial bids;

iii)

The techno-commercial bids are to be opened in the first instance on the bid opening
date and time, and scrutinised and evaluated by the TC with reference to parameters
prescribed in the tender documents and responsive, eligible and technically
compliant bidders are decided;

iv)

Thereafter, in the second instance, the financial bids of only the techno-commercially
compliant offers (as decided in the first instance above) are to be opened on a preannounced date and time for further scrutiny, evaluation, ranking and placement of
contract. The financial bids of technically non-compliant bidders should be returned
unopened to the respective bidders by registered acknowledgement due/reliable
courier or any other mode with proof of delivery. In e-Procurement, financial bids of
technically non-compliant offers would not get opened;

4.13.3 Single Stage Multiple Envelops System with pre-qualification: As discussed
below, where the procurement is moderately complex and the time, effort and money
required from the bidder to participate in a tender is not very high, instead of a separate
stage of Pre-Qualification bidding (as described below, a clear-cut, fail-pass qualification
criteria can be asked to be submitted as the first (additional) envelop in a three envelop
single stage bidding, so that a bidder's risk of having his bid rejected on grounds of
qualifications is remote if due diligence is exercised him. Strictly speaking, this is not a prequalification but a Post-qualification of bidders. In the first instance on the bid opening date

70

only the PQB envelops (also containing the EMD and other eligibility documents) are opened
and evaluated to shortlist the responsive bidders who pass the Pre-qualification. Rest of
procedure is same as two envelop system for only qualified bidders. Rest two envelops of
unqualified bidders are returned un opened to the respective bidders by registered
acknowledgement due/reliable courier or any other mode with proof of delivery;
4.13.4 Pre-qualification Bidding (PQB)
i) In complex technical requirements where capability of source of supply is crucial (for
example in procurement of complex machinery and equipments), for the successful
performance of the contract, besides considering techno-commercial suitability, it is
necessary to ensure that competition is only among bidders with requisite capabilities
matching the challenges of the task. In case bidders with inadequate capability are
allowed to compete, the better qualified bidders would be eliminated since their bid price
is likely to be higher commensurate with their higher capability infrastructure. Such
situations a separate stage of PQB bidding system may be considered (or single stage
multiple envelop bidding – please refer para above). In PQB stage, competent qualified
tenderers are shortlisted by using a Pre-qualification Criterion (PQC – for example, i)
past experience of similar contracts, ii) performance capability and iii) financial strength)
prior to the issue of the bid document exclusively to shortlisted bidders in the second
stage. Pre-qualification Bids (PQBs) should meet the norms of transparency, fairness
and maintenance of competition. Since PQB system may strain the transparency
principle and there is heightened risk of cartelization among shortlisted bidders, PQB
should be done only as an exception under specified circumstances. It should not be a
routine/ normal mode of procurement of goods and an eligibility criteria clause as part of
single/two envelop/cover tendering should suffice in normal/ routine situations. PQB
bidding as a separate stage is contraindicated in the following circumstances:
a) Where procurement can be done through limited tender enquiries;
b) Where the Procuring Entity has at least three registered bidders of the
category and grade matching tendered scope of procurement and financial
limit;
c) Where the requirement is technically and commercially simple enough that
pre-qualification of the bidder is not crucial for the performance of the
contract, for example, Commercially Off The Shelf (COTS) requirements; and
d) Where the procurement is moderately complex and the time, effort and
money required from the bidder to participate in a tender is not very high. A
clear-cut, fail-pass post-qualification criteria can be specified in a three
envelop single stage bidding (instead of two stage bidding), so that a bidder’s
risk of having his bid rejected on grounds of qualifications is remote if due
diligence is exercised him.
ii) Pre-qualification Criteria: PQC should be unrestrictive enough so as not to leave out
even one capable vendor/contractor. Otherwise, it can lead to higher prices of
procurement/works/services. However, on the other hand, these criteria should be
restrictive enough so as not to allow even one incapable vendor/contractor and thus

71

vitiate fair competition for capable vendors/contractors to the detriment of the buyer’s
objectives. A misjudgement in either direction may be detrimental. Certain guidelines50
regarding the framing of PQC have been laid down. A sample PQC is given in Annexure
9. Due consideration should be given while framing PQC, to its effect on adequacy of
competition. To encourage MSEs, past successful bidders, a call may be taken –
whether PQC should apply to full quantity/packages or be proportional to part
quantity/package quoted by a bidder. In case requirement is suddenly a multiple times
the past procurements, blind adoption of past PQCs may lead to disqualification of
successful past vendors leading to inadequate competition. PQC should therefore be
carefully decided for each procurement with the approval of CA for acceptance of the
tender. It should be clarified in the PQB documents that bidders have to submit
authenticated documents in support of eligibility criteria.
iii) Advertisement and Notification: The invitation for PQB shall be processed (advertised,
bid document preparation, publicity and evaluation, and so on) in the same manner as a
normal GTE or OTE (as the situation calls for) tender, ensuring the widest possible
coverage. The PQC and evaluation criterion should be notified clearly in the PQB
documents. The PQB documents should also indicate a complete schedule of
requirements for which this PQB is being done, including approximate likely quantities of
requirements. A minimum period of 45 (forty-five) days may be allowed for the
submission of PQBs. In the case of urgency, duly approved by CA, the time limit may be
reduced to 30 (thirty) days.
iv) Evaluation: At least in high value and critical procurements, the credentials regarding
experience and past performance, submitted by the successful bidder, may be verified
as per eligibility criteria, as far as reasonably feasible, from the parties for whom work
has been claimed to be done. The procuring entity shall evaluate the qualifications of
bidders only in accordance with the PQC specified and shall give due publicity to the
particulars of the bidders that are qualified on the relevant portals/ websites.
v)

Subsequent Procurement Tender: The pre-qualification shall be valid for such
period as may be specified in the pre-qualification document and for a single
subsequent procurement within this period, except when it is determined that
engaging in fresh pre-qualification shall not result in enhanced competition. During
the period of such validity, the procuring entity shall invite bids for procurement
(Request for Proposals – RfP) from pre-qualified bidders and all other bids may be
treated as unsolicited offers which are normally rejected. In case bids are not invited
within such a period, fresh pre-qualification shall be done. It is desirable that the time
gap between the pre-qualification approval and floating of the linked main
procurement tender is less than six months.
4.13.5 Pre-Qualification Bidding –Risks and Mitigations:

potential of getting misused or being
applied without considering the restrictive

nature of competition. PQC should be
relevant to the quality requirements and
neither is very stringent nor very lax to
restrict/facilitate the entry of bidders. These
criteria should be clear, unambiguous,
exhaustive and yet specific. Also, there
should be fair competition.

Mitigation
criteria for different types of procurements.

Dangers of Anti-competitive bidding:
Since in a two stage PQB, shortlisted
bidders are announced, there is heightened
possibility of these bidders forming a cartel
and quoting anti-competitive prices in the
second stage of bidding.

Two stage PQB should be done only in
appropriately
justified
situations.
Alternatively Single Stage multiple envelop
system may be used for prequalification, in
which
chances
of
anti-competitive
behaviour and time-taken is significantly
lesser.

Two Stage PQB is a time-consuming
process.
Contentious and Disputes: Both the
successful and unsuccessful bidders tend
to view PQB process as a means
forcreating rights/ privileges/ entitlement for
them by way of hair-splitting, contentious or
viciously legalistic interpretations of PQC
criteria, disregarding the very rationale of
the PQB and PQC.

In the PQC a caveat against such
tendencies may be included, asserting the
right of procuring agency to interpret the
PQC on common usage of terminologies
and phrases in public procurement instead
of legalistic and hair-splitting judgements
and that their decision in this regard would
be final.

4.14 Two Stage Bidding - Expression of Interest Tenders – Market
Exploration
4.14.1
There are instances where the equipment/ plant to be procured is of complex
nature and the procuring organization may not possess the full knowledge of either the
various technical solutions available or the likely sources for such products in the market. To
meet the desired objectives of a transparent procurement that ensures value for money
simultaneously ensuring upgradation of technology &capacity building- it would be prudent to
invite a two-stage Expression of Interest (EoI) Bids and proceed to explore the market and to
finalise specifications based on technical discussions/presentations with the experienced
manufacturers/suppliers in a transparent manner. Expression of Interest (EoI) bids may be
invited in following situations:
i)

It is not feasible for the procuring entity to formulate detailed specifications or
identify specific characteristics for the subject matter of procurement, without
receiving inputs regarding its technical aspects from bidders;

ii)

The character of the subject matter of procurement is subject to rapid
technological advances or market fluctuations or both;

73

iii)

The procuring entity seeks to enter into a contract for the purpose of research,
experiment, study or development, except where the contract includes the
production of requirements in quantities sufficient to establish their commercial
viability or to recover research and development costs; or

iv)

The bidder is expected to carry out a detailed survey or investigation and
undertake a comprehensive assessment of risks, costs and obligations
associated with the particular procurement.

(Rule 164 of GFR 2017)
4.14.2

The procedure for two stage bidding shall include the following, namely:

i)

In the first stage of the bidding process, the procuring entity shall invite EoI bids
containing the broad objectives, technical and financial eligibility criteria, terms
and conditions of the proposed procurement etc without a bid price. On receipt of
the Expressions of Interest, technical discussions/presentations may be held with
the short-listed manufacturers/suppliers, which are prima facie considered
technically and financially capable of supplying the material or executing the
proposed work, giving equal opportunity to all such bidders to participate in the
discussions. During these technical discussions stage the procurement agency
may also add those other stakeholders in the discussions who could add value to
the decision making on the various technical aspects and evaluation criteria.
Based on the discussions/ presentations so held, one or more acceptable
technical solutions could be decided upon laying down detailed technical
specifications for each acceptable technical solution, quality benchmarks,
warranty requirements, delivery milestones etc. in a manner that is consistent
with the objectives of the transparent procurement. At the same time care should
be taken to make the specifications generic in nature so as to provide equitable
opportunities
to
the
prospective
bidders.
Proper
record
of
discussions/presentations and the process of decision making should be kept;

ii)

In revising the relevant terms and conditions of the procurement, if found
necessary as a result of discussions with the shortlisted bidders, the procuring
entity shall not modify the fundamental nature of the procurement itself;

iii)

In the second stage of the bidding process, the procuring entity shall invite bids
from all those bidders whose bids at the first stage were not rejected, to present
final bid with bid prices in response to a revised set of terms and conditions of the
procurement; and

iv)

Any bidder, invited to bid but not in a position to supply the subject matter of
procurement due to modification in the specifications or terms and conditions,
may withdraw from the bidding proceedings without forfeiting any bid security that
he may have been required to provide or being penalised in any way, by
declaring his intention to withdraw from the procurement proceedings with
adequate justification.

v)

If the procuring entity is of the view that after EoI stage, there is likelihood of
further participation by many more bidders and to avoid getting trapped into a
legacy technology, the second stage bidding may not be restricted only to the
shortlisted bidders of EoI stage and it may be so declared in the EoI document

74

ab-initio. Thereafter in the second stage, normal OTE/ GTE bidding may be done.
Such variant of EoIis called ‘Non-committal’ EoI.
4.14.3
Invitation of EoI Tenders: In EoI tenders, an advertisement inviting
expression of interest should be published. The invitation to the EoI document should
contain the following information:
i)

A copy of the advertisement;

ii)

Objectives and scope of the requirement: This may include a brief description of
objectives and broad scope of the requirement. It may also include the validity period
of empanelment;

iii)

Instructions to the bidders: This may include instructions regarding the nature of
supply, fees for empanelment (if any), last date of submission, place of submission
and any other related instructions;

iv)

Formats for submission: This section should specify the format in which the
bidders are expected to submit their EoI;

v)

The EoI document should be made available to the interested bidder as a hard copy
as well as on its website in a downloadable form; and

vi)

Eligibility criteria: The invitation to EoI should clearly lay down the eligibility criteria,
which should be applied for shortlisting. Supporting documents required need to be
clearly mentioned. An example of EoI eligibility criteria is shown in Table 1. However,
appropriate eligibility criteria have to be designed, keeping in mind the specific
objectives of the EoI.

* Weightage (out of 100) should be pre-decided and declared in EoI documents by the CA based on assessment of the
required profiles of the potential bidders. The marking/grading scheme for allotting marks (out of 100) for various parameters
should also be laid down.
4.14.4 Evaluation of EoI: The bidders should be evaluated for shortlisting, inter-alia, based
on their past experience of performance in a similar context, financial strength and technical
capabilities, among others. Each bidder should be assigned scores based on the sum of
marks obtained for each parameter multiplied by the weightage assigned to that parameter.
All bidders who secure the minimum required marks (normally 60 (sixty) per cent) should be
shortlisted. The minimum qualifying marks should be specified in the EoI document.
Alternatively, instead of weighted evaluation, the EoI document may specify a ‘fail-pass
criteria’ with the minimum qualifying requirement for each of the criteria, such as minimum
years of experience, minimum number of assignments executed and minimum turnover.
Under such circumstances, all bidders who meet the minimum requirement, as specified,
should be shortlisted. The short list should normally comprise at least four firms.
Pre-Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) Conference: In complex and innovative procurement cases
or where the procuring entity may not have the required knowledge to formulate tender
provisions, a pre-NIT conference may help the procuring entity in obtaining inputs from the
industry. Such conferences should be widely publicised so that different potential suppliers
can attend.

4.15

Electronic Procurement (e-Procurement)

It is mandatory for Ministries/ Departments to receive all bids through e-procurement portals
in respect of all procurements. Ministries/ Departments which do not have a large volume of
procurement or carry out procurements required only for day-to-day running of offices and
also have not initiated e-procurement through any other solution provided so far may use eprocurement solution developed by NIC. Other Ministries/ Departments may either use eprocurement solution developed by NIC or engage any other service provider following due
process51. In individual cases where national security and strategic considerations demands
confidentiality, Ministries/ Departments may exempt such cases from e-procurement after
seeking approval of concerned Secretary and with concurrence of Financial Advisers. In
case of tenders floated by Indian Missions Abroad, Competent Authority to decide the tender
may exempt such case from e-procurement. National Informatics Centre (NIC) has an eProcurement portal called Government e-Procurement of NIC (GePNIC). There are other
service providers in Public Sector (e.g. MSTC) and Private sector which can be utilized for eProcurement. Details about the process of e-procurement are available from the service
providers. Appendix 3 also gives such generic details of the e-Procurement process.(Rule
160 of GFR 2017)

4.16

Electronic Reverse Auction (RA)

Electronic Reverse Auction is a type of auction (classified as dynamic procurement method)
where the starting price, bid decrement, duration of auction, maximum number of automatic
extensions are announced before start of online reverse auction. If required, RA may be
preceded by an e-Procurement stage of eligibility/ PQB to shortlist competent bidders who
would be allowed to participate in the RA. The shortlisted bidders can after the start of RA
start bidding online in an iterative process wherein the lowest bidder at any given moment
can be displaced by an even lower bid of a competing bidder, within the duration of the RA.
If a new lower bid is received within last few minutes (say two minutes) of closing time, the
closing time may get automatically extended by few minutes (say five minutes) for others to
respond. Maximum number of such extensions may be stipulated (say five). The most
favourable bid at the end of stipulated / extended time is declared as successful. While
permitting use of RA, CVC has asked the Departments/organisations to themselves decide
on reverse auction for purchases or sales and work out the detailed procedure in this
regard52. It has, however, to be ensured that the entire process is conducted in a transparent
and fair manner. A procuring entity may choose to procure a subject matter of procurement
by the electronic reverse auction method, if:
i)

Items for Reverse Auction may be selected carefully. Items of strategic, critical
and vital nature, items in short supply in market and where there are only a few
suppliers are not good candidates for reverse auction. Items in the nature of
commodities, Commercially-off-the-shelf items, items having large number of
suppliers and high value procurements may be more amenable to reverse
auction;

ii)

It is feasible for the procuring entity to formulate a detailed description of the
subject matter of the procurement;

iii)

There is a competitive market of bidders anticipated to be qualified to participate
in the electronic reverse auction, so that effective competition is ensured;

iv)

The criteria to be used by the procuring entity in determining the successful bid
are quantifiable and can be expressed in monetary terms;

v)

In cases where pre-qualification of bidders is considered necessary, reverse
auction may be carried out after a separate PQB (electronic or otherwise) among
the successful bidders only.

4.16.1 Subject to more detailed guidelines in the category-specific manual or other
guidelines, the procedure for electronic reverse auction shall include the following, namely:
i)

The procuring entity shall solicit bids through an invitation to the electronic
reverse auction to be published or communicated in accordance with the
provisions similar to e-procurement; and

ii)

The invitation shall, in addition to the information as specified in e-procurement,
include details relating to:
a) Access to and registration for the auction;

52

http://cvc.gov.in/ord46903.pdf

77

b) Opening and closing of the auction;
c) Norms for conduct of the auction; and
d) Any other information as may be relevant to the method of procurement.
(Rule 167 of GFR 2017)

4.17

One Stop Government e-Marketplace (GeM)

4.17.1
An online marketplace (or e-commerce marketplace) is a type of e-commerce
site where product or services are offered by a number of sellers and all the buyers can
select the product/ services offered by any one of the seller, based on his own criteria. In an
online marketplace, Purchaser’s transactions are processed by the marketplace operator
and then product/ services are delivered and fulfilled directly by the participating retailers.
Other capabilities might include auctioning (forward or reverse), catalogues, ordering,
posting of requirements by Purchasers, Payment gateways etc. In general, because online
marketplaces aggregate products from a wide array of providers, selection is usually wider,
availability is higher, and prices are more competitive than in vendor-specific online retail
stores.
4.17.2
Ministry of Commerce has developed an online Government e-Market Place
for common use goods and services. The procurement process on GeM is end to end from
placement of supply order to payment to suppliers. This is to ensure better transparency and
higher efficiency. All the process will be electronic and online. The Procurement of Goods
and Services by Ministries or Departments is mandatory for Goods or Services available on
GeM as per Rule 149 of GFR, 2017.
4.17.3
Products and services are listed on GeM by various suppliers as on
other e-Commerce portals: The registration of suppliers on GeM is online and automatic
based on PAN, MCA-21, Aadhar authentication etc. The suppliers offer their products on
GeM and the Government buyer are able to view all the products as well as compare them.
Tools of reverse bidding and e-auction are also available which can be utilised for the
procurement of bulk quantities.
4.17.4
Demand Aggregation: The best prices to a user can be available if same
requirement demands of various organizations are aggregated. This acts as an incentive for
the supplier to quote their best price. For the same products, the demand of various Govt.
Departments can be clubbed together and reverse auction done on the basis of aggregated
demand which will provide the best prices to the Govt. Department.
4.17.5
Authority of procurement through GeM: Procurement through GeM has
been authorised as per GFR, 2017 Rule 149:“Government e-Market Place (GeM):Government of India has established the Government
e-Marketplace (GeM) for common use Goods and Services. GeM SPV will ensure adequate
publicity including periodic advertisement of the items to be procured through GeM for the
prospective suppliers. The Procurement of Goods and Services by Ministries or
Departments will be mandatory for Goods or Services available on GeM. The credentials of
suppliers on GeM shall be certified by GeM SPV. The procuring authorities will certify the

78

reasonability of rates. The GeM portal shall be utilized by the Government buyers for direct
on-line purchases as under53:i)

ii)

Up to {Rs.25,000/-}54 through any of the available suppliers on the GeM, meeting the
requisite quality, specification, and delivery period (in case of procurement of
Automobiles only the ceiling of direct purchase will be Rs.30 lakh instead of Rs.
25,000/-55);
Above Rs.25,000/- and up to Rs.5,00,000/- through the GeM Seller having lowest
price amongst the available sellers (excluding Automobiles where current limit of 30
lakh will continue), of at least three different manufacturers, on GeM, meeting the
requisite quality, specification, and delivery period. The tools for online bidding and
online reverse auction available on GeM can be used by the Buyer even for
procurements less than Rs 5,00,000.

.
iii)

Above Rs.5,00,000/- through the supplier having lowest price meeting the requisite
quality, specification, and delivery period after mandatorily obtaining bids, using
online bidding or reverse auction tool provided on GeM (excluding Automobiles
where current limit of 30 lakh will continue).56
iv)
The invitation for the online e-bidding/reverse auction will be available to all the
existing Sellers or other Sellers registered on the portal and who have offered their
goods/services under the particular product/service category, as per terms and
conditions of GeM.
v)
The above mentioned monetary ceiling is applicable only for purchases made
through GeM. For purchases, if any, outside GeM, relevant GFR Rules shall apply.
vi)
The Ministries/Departments shall work out their procurement requirements of Goods
and Services on either “OPEX” model or “CAPEX” model as per their
requirement/suitability at the time of preparation of Budget Estimates (BE) and shall
project their Annual Procurement Plan of goods and services on GeM portal within 30
(thirty) days of Budget approval.
vii)
The Government Buyers may ascertain the reasonableness of prices before
placement of order using the Business Analytics (BA) tools available on GeM
including the Last Purchase Price on GeM, Department’s own Last Purchase Price
etc.
viii)
A demand for goods shall not be divided into small quantities to make piecemeal
purchases to avoid procurement through L-1 Buying / bidding / reverse auction on
GeM or the necessity of obtaining the sanction of higher authorities required with
reference to the estimated value of the total demand.”
It may be noted that . itis the responsibility of the Procuring Entity to do due diligence for
ensuring reasonableness of rates.

4.17.7 Payment Procedure in GeM: The payment procedure in GeM is governed by O.M.
No. F.26/4/2016-PPD dated 23rdJanuary, 202057 issued by D/o. Expenditure, M/o. Finance,
New Delhi. The following procedures are prescribed for making payments to the Sellers/
Service Providers in GeM which shall be complied and adhered to by all concerned for
different type of contracts such as:
a.
Supply of Goods & Services
b.
Supply, Installation, Testing and Commissioning of Goods
c.
Supply, Installation, Testing, Commissioning of Goods and Training of
operators and providing Statutory Clearances required (if any)
i)

In respect of contracts for Supply of Goods, 100% payment including GST should be
made after receipt and acceptance of Goods and generation of “Goods CRAC”
(Consignee Receipt and Acceptance Certificate) subject to recoveries, if any, either
on account of short supply and Liquidated Damages etc. for delay in supply.

ii)

In respect of contracts for Services, payment should be made as per periodicity
defined in the contract i.e. Monthly, Quarterly or any other pre-defined payment
periodicity. 100% payment including GST for the particular payment cycle should be
made after receipt and acceptance of the Services and generation of “Service CRAC”
(Consignee Receipt and Acceptance Certificate) subject to recoveries, if any, either
on account of short supply, SLA (Service Level Agreement) deviations and
Liquidated Damages for delay in supply etc.

iii)

In respect of contracts for Supply, Installation, Testing, Commissioning of Goods and
Training of operators etc. the complete cost break-up indicating Basic price, GST,
Installation and commissioning charges, Incidental Services, training etc. is to be
indicated separately in the bid. In order to cater to installation intensive products, the
different configurable payment terms will have to be incorporated in GeM
functionalities (depending upon the quantum of installation and turnkey work
required).
a.

First Milestone - On delivery of goods: 80 to 90% payment (lower initial
payment if installation scope is very extensive) of the basic price of Goods
along with 100% GST on the Goods Price but excluding installation, testing
and commissioning and other charges should be paid after receipt Goods and
generation of “Delivery CRAC for initial payment”. This will be issued after

The payments on GeM are primarily categorized under two heads i.e. through PFMS
or GeM Pool Account. The detailed instructions for both type of payment system are
as under:

A.

Payments through PFMS:

1. The Central Government Buyer i.e. the concerned Programme Division or Administrative
Unit in a Ministry/ Department will place the Contract online after taking prior approval of the
Competent Authority for procuring a particular Good or Service. Inter-alia, the Contract form
will also contain the following fields including fields required for payment related processes:

81

a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)
g)
h)

Administrative approval of the Competent Authority indicating the designation
of the approving authority,
Approval of Competent Financial Authority indicating designation of the
officer;
Whether IFD concurrence required? (Yes/No)
If yes, then IFD Diary No. & Date
Budget Head of Account and Year, Major/Minor/Sub-head/Detailed
Head/Object Head as in Detailed Demands for Grants.
Budget availability as on date (Yes/No)
Amount (Contract Value)) Rs (Budget to be blocked)
If expenditure is committed for more than a year, the year-wise details (portal
should generate a Liability Register for recording multi-year payment
commitments, the format for which is prescribed in Rule 53 of the GFR)

2. When these fields are duly captured, the Buyer will be in a position to place the Contract
online. The GeM portal will generate a Sanction Order and the Contract which will be
digitally/e-signed by the Buyer. These documents duly digitally/e-signed by the Buyer will be
made available online to the concerned DDO and PAO or Paying Authority as defined in the
contract and Seller/ Service Provider. The DDO and PAO/Paying Authority shall have
access to the Contract online in order to ensure that the Bill is generated at the stage of
payment in accordance with the contractual provisions.
3. The GeM portal will send the Sanction Order details to PFMS.
4. On issue of Sanction order and placing the Contract for goods, the full amount required
from the relevant Budget Head should be blocked in the PFMS. In cases of Services,
amount should be blocked for one payment cycle as defined in the contract. Before releasing
payment for any cycle, the funds required for the next payment cycle should be blocked so
as to ensure availability of payable funds for the next payment cycle. Blocked fund will be
treated as accrued expenditure by PFMS for the financial year in question and it will not be
withdrawn for any other purpose other than the one for which the amount is Blocked. In
order to alleviate the operational issues as well as to ensure optimum utilization of available
funds, the following additions58 are made in para 9.7.7 (vi) (A) (4)
a.

58

The provision of fund blocking equivalent to full contract value is applicable
only for contracts with delivery periods of up to 20 days. For contracts with
longer delivery periods, fund blocking of appropriate amounts shall be
initiated at a date 20 days prior to expected delivery date or on the date of
invoice generation by the Seller in GeM whichever is earlier. In case of nonavailability of required funds at that point of time, both buyer and seller shall
be alerted, and the Buyer, the HoD, the DDO/ PAO and finally up to AS&FA
of concerned Ministry/ Department shall be alerted by email and SMS by
GeM. On failure in making available the required funds in the appropriate
head of account within 10 days, seller has right to decline supply and to seek
contract cancellation without any administrative action against the seller. Also,

Notified vide OM No. F.6/18/2019.PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 29.12.2020

82

in such a case, any delay in delivery by the seller will also become exempt
from the provision of Liquidated Damages.
b.

Functionality to un-block the blocked funds in exceptional cases/ emergency
cases with some validations: Head of Department (HoD) of the organization
on GeM can unblock certain % of blocked funds of a contract (may be upto
100%) with the approval of associated finance of the Ministry/ Department or
the CPSE in exceptional cases/ emergency cases after giving a clear
undertaking that he will ensure timely availability of funds and unblocking will
not lead to delay payments to sellers. However, such unblocking will not
allowed if the seller has already raised an invoice (before 1st March of
Financial Year).

c.

Funds for the relevant financial year should be blocked only if the
delivery period is such that the delivery is scheduled before the 1st of
March of that financial year. If the delivery is scheduled in March of that
financial year or scheduled in the next financial year then fund blocking is
optional for buyer in current financial year and mandatory only in the next
financial year in the 1st week of April.

5. Should it be necessary to amend the Contract, such Amendment in the Contract with due
approval of the Competent Authority and acceptance of the Seller/Service Provider
(wherever
required)
shall
be
made
available
to
the
Seller
/Service
Provider/DDO/PAO/Paying Authority on the GeM portal.
6. Similarly, in the event of complete/ partial cancellation of the Contract the information
would be made available to the Seller/Service Provider, DDO and PAO on the GeM portal. In
that event, funds so blocked earlier would be released to the extent of cancelled amount.
7. The Programme Division/Administrative Unit in the Ministries/Departments shall
periodically review the blocked budget to ensure that funds are utilized within the same
financial year.
8. The Performance Security (if any)would be obtained from the Seller/Service Provider as
per Contract, and their details would be reflected on the GeM portal by the Buyer.
9. Provisional Receipt of Stores on GeM:
a.

On dispatch of Goods, the Seller would enter the Dispatch Details and date of
Dispatch and will upload documentary evidence of Dispatch against each
consignment on GeM Portal. All these documents and details shall be shown
to the Consignee on his dashboard and shall also be notified to the consignee
on his e-mail and on his registered mobile number.

b.

The Seller shall prepare an electronic Invoice, digitally/e-signed, on GeM
portal and shall submit the same on-line to the Buyer. GeM portal will send an
SMS/ email alert to the Buyer, on submission of Invoice. This Invoice will
contain mode of dispatch of goods, dispatched/delivered quantity with date
and all inclusive price claimed based on digitally/e-signed Contract. In case
Services are procured, the required data as per Contract may be incorporated
in the Invoice.

83

c.

After actual delivery of goods at consignee destination/ milestone
achievement (such as completion of installation/ commissioning or training
etc. as defined in the contract)/ service delivery, Seller would enter the actual
date of delivery/ milestone achievement/ Service Log-sheet (as applicable)
and will upload documentary evidence for the same duly digitally signed / esigned. All these documents and details shall be shown to the Consignee on
his dashboard and shall also be notified to the consignee on his e-mail and on
his registered mobile number. In case of Services Contracts, the Service
Provider will fill up the required data as per the contract (such as log sheets
and /or Invoice etc duly digitally signed/ e-signed).

d.

Immediately upon above entry by Seller I Service Provider regarding delivery
of goods/ milestone achievement/ service delivery, an alert will be flashed on
the Dashboard of the consignee and an email and an SMS Alert will be sent
to Consignee informing that consignee has to mandatorily acknowledge
receipt of stores/ milestone achievement/ service delivery through generation
of PRC on GeM. The Buyer/Consignee should receive the Goods/Services
and issues an online Provisional Receipt Certificate (PRC), within 48 hours,
on 'said to contain basis’ on the GeM portal with his/her digital signature / esign, mentioning the date of Receipt. (From this date of receipt mentioned in
PRC, the period of ten (10) days for consignee's/buyer's right of rejection and
return policy would be applicable unless otherwise specified in a particular
contract)

e.

In case the consignee does not issue PRC within 48 hrs from entry of delivery
of goods/ milestone achievement/ service delivery by Seller/ Service Provider,
an alert will be flashed on the dashboard of the consignee and an email and
an SMS Alert will be sent to Consignee and Buyer informing that consignee
has to mandatorily acknowledge receipt of stores/ milestone achievement/
service delivery through generation of PRC on GeM.

f.

After expiry of 72 hrs. from the first alert, another alert will be flashed on the
dashboard of the Consignee, Buyer including HoD and an email along with an
SMS Alert to Consignee , Buyer, HoD informing that consignee has to
mandatorily acknowledge receipt of stores/ milestone achievement/ service
delivery through generation of PRC on GeM and if the time limit of 96 hrs
expires from the date of delivery of goods/ milestone achievement/ service
delivery as per entry made by Seller/ Service provider and if the consignee
does not acknowledge receipt of stores/ milestone achievement/ service
delivery by generating PRC or disputes the same by rejecting receipt, it would
be presumed that goods have been delivered/milestone achievement I
service delivery has been made to consignee and PRC will be auto generated
by the system (Deemed PRC).

g.

However, if the consignee does not issue PRC within 96 hrs from delivery of
goods/ milestone achievement/ service delivery as per entry made by Seller/
Service provider ,GeM System/Portal would auto generate unsigned PRC
considering the date of delivery of goods/ milestone achievement/ service
delivery as indicated by the seller as deemed date of receipt for issuance of
PRC. GeM portal shall also send periodic notifications every 24 hrs. to the

84

Consignee, Buyer and the HoD about issuance of auto generated Deemed
PRC for next 48 hrs.
h.

In case the PRC is auto-generated, the consignee shall have the provision on
GeM to respond back within 48 hrs, if the goods have not been received or
short received recommending to cancel or amend/correct the date of receipt/
quantity in the auto-generated Deemed PRC. In case nothing is reported/
corrected by consignee on the system, it will be presumed that the consignee
has nothing to say and the auto-generated Deemed PRC will be considered
as final for all purposes.

i.

If it is found at any stage that seller/ service provider has sent/ uploaded
wrong information on GeM, based on which PRC has been wrongly auto
generated, the seller/ service provider will be dealt severely and should be
debarred by GeM for three years.

10. Consignee Receipt and Acceptance of Stores on GeM:
After issue of PRC/ Deemed PRC, the system will start sending an alert on the Dashboard of
the consignee and an email and an SMS Alert will be sent as per escalation matrix specified
below to issue the CRAC within 10 days:
a.
b.
c.

Level 1 - Upto 3 days - Consignee
Level 2-4 and 5th day - Consignee and Buyer
Level 3 - 6 to 10th day - Consignee, Buyer, HOD

After verification including assessment of quality and quantity of goods /verification of
completion of all deliverables defined in the milestone/ completion of service for the defined
period, the Consignee(s) will issue an on-line digitally/e-signed Consignee's Receipt &
Acceptance Certificate (CRAC) (Goods CRAC/Service CRAC/ Delivery CRAC/ Installation
CRAC/ Final CRAC as the case may be) (within 10 days (unless otherwise specified in a
particular contract) of date of receipt indicated in PRC/deemed date of receipt as indicated in
Deemed PRC. The CRAC would clearly indicate the Order quantity/ milestone achievement/
service delivery, rejected quantity/ unacceptable milestone achievement /unacceptable
service delivery (if any, with reasons for rejection including shortages/damaged/unaccepted
quality), quantity/ milestone achievement/ service delivery accepted and cleared for
payment. However, if the consignee does not issue CRAC within 10 days (unless some
other time line is specified in a particular contract for issue of CRAC), on 11th day from the
date of receipt/ deemed date of receipt of quantity/ milestone achievement / service delivery
as indicated in PRC, GeM System/Portal would auto generate unsigned CRAC which,
backed with digitally/e-signed PRC or deemed PRC based on Seller Evidence for the
corresponding quantity/ milestone achievement/ service delivery shall be taken as deemed
acceptance for payments in lieu of the requirement of digitally/e-signed CRAC. This will be
made available on GeM to the Buyer/ Seller and also the concerned DDO (if applicable) and
PAO/Paying Authority. The GeM portal would generate a unique serial number for CRAC
relating to concerned DDO (if applicable) & PAO/Paying Authority, so that the payments are
made seriatim.
In case the CRAC is auto-generated, the consignee shall have the provision on GeM to
cancel or amend the auto-generated CRAC within 72 hrs, if the goods have not been
accepted or found defective/ short received. In case nothing is corrected by consignee on

85

the system, it will be presumed that the consignee has nothing to say and the autogenerated CRAC will be considered as final for all purposes including payments.
11. After generation of CRAC, the Buyer shall prepare 'Payment advice' on GeM Portal,
indicating any contractual deductions such as penalties for violation of Service Level
Agreement (as applicable)/Liquidated Damages for delayed supplies/ milestone
achievement/ service delivery etc. which will be used by GeM portal to compute the net
amount payable for the accepted quantity/milestone achievement/service delivery after
factoring in the contractual deduction(s) and generate claims for payments digitally/e-signed
by the Buyer. This claim for payment shall be made available to the DDO on GeM Portal and
the requisite data will also be pushed online in the PFMS. DDO will log into PFMS and
generate the Bill against the said claims and forward the same to the PAO/Paying Authority
for payment, after deducting any statuary deductions including TDS as applicable.
12. It is obligatory to make payments without any delay for purchases made on GeM. In no
case should it take longer than the prescribed timelines. The timelines after Consignee
Receipt and Acceptance Certificate (CRAC) issued on-line and digitally/e-signed by
consignee, will be two (2) working days for Buyer, one (1) working day for concerned DDO
and two (2) working days for concerned PAO for triggering payment through PFMS for
crediting to the supplier's account. In case of return of Bills by PAO/Paying authority, the
discrepancies should be addressed by concerned Buyer/DDO within one working day and
thereafter on re- submission of Bill the PAO should also not take more than one (1) working
day for triggering payment to the Seller/ service provider Any matter needing a resolution will
be escalated to the next higher level in each agency (Buyer, DDO and PAO) where the
matter should be resolved within 24 hours. In the entire process, time taken for payment
should not exceed ten (10) days including holidays
13. After online pre-check of all relevant documents, PAO/Paying Authority shall debit the
Government account, releasing the corresponding payment through PFMS/ to be credited
into the bank account of the Seller/service Provider. The payment so released shall be
credited to the Seller/Service Provider account within 24 hours (excluding public holidays),
by the Bank. SMS alerts shall be sent to the Seller/Service Provider and Buyer after the

The payment authorization as well as payment confirmation details shall be shared by PFMS
on the GeM portal. The PAO/Paying Authority and DDO shall comply with the provisions of
General Financial Rules for budget implementation.
14. In case of return of Bill, if necessary by PAO/Paying Authority, it should be made online
with all queries/discrepancies/reasons for rejections indicated in one go with the approval of
competent authority, to the DDO/Buyer for the needful corrections at their end.
15. The DDO shall also be responsible for issuing TDS certificate (as per Income Tax Act,

Service Providers must be released online only against electronic bill generated on
GeM. No offline payment should be made in such cases to avoid double payment.
Only in exceptional cases such as non-availability of the GeM platform or long
shutdown of internet services at Buyer location or similar force majeure conditions,
such off-line payments can be resorted to subject to the condition that immediately
after resolution of the problem, necessary entries would be made on-line in GeM
portal to obviate the possibility of double payment.
B.

Payment for Non-PFMS Agencies/ Entities (NPAE)

1. Non-PFMS Agency/ Entity (NPAE) is a Government of India (Gol) not using PFMS for its
payments of transactions and having their own payment system for making payments
against contracts placed for goods/services placed by the NPAE on GeM. All NPAE shall
open & operate a special purpose account namely GeM Pool Account for the purpose of
ensuring prompt payment to Seller/Service Provider of GeM who supply Goods/ Services to
the NPAE through GeM.
2. Accordingly, all the Organisations/ Departments including CPSUs, Municipalities,
Educational Institutions, Autonomous bodies, Societies, etc. not operating through PFMS
shall be covered under these instructions. These organisations are hereby directed to open,
operationalize and operate a GeM Pool Account (GPA) for all procurement. GPA is a special
purpose bank account (interest bearing savings/current Account) opened, operated and
controlled exclusively by each NPAE. GeM Pool Account shall be mandatory for all
procurement irrespective of value. The GeM Pool Account shall be opened, operated and
controlled exclusively and completely by the buyer entity/agency subject to certain
restrictions on withdrawals of funds as explained in succeeding paragraphs .The Account
shall carry interest applicable to savings/ current account. Such account shall be opened in
any scheduled bank having already integrated the pool account with GeM.
3. The following are the core elements of GPA that should be incorporated during the
opening and operations/ procurement stages:
a.

The NPAE will open the GPA (as a savings or current account) which will be
utilized by buyer through the online integration of Bank with the platform
owned and maintained by GeM SPV, as per Service Level Agreement (SLA),
and solely for procurement of goods and services on GeM.

b.

The terms and conditions of procurement on GeM will be part of the
operations agreement between the bank and the NPAE.

87

c.

The role of the bank will be limited to ensuring operations of the account on
the instruction of the NPAE through the authorized NPAE nodal officer for
GeM/ buyer.

d.

Real time details of all operations of the account will be shared by the bank, in
a mutually accepted format (to be amended from time to time) with the NPAE,
only through the GeM Platform.

e.

Once a sub-account/ transaction specific account is credited with an amount,
the NPAE cannot withdraw this amount, apart from transfer to the designated
Seller/Service Provider, till such a time that the transaction is live.

f.
Any withdrawal/transfer by the NPAE from this account, except for payment to
the Seller I Service Provider, would be permitted in the following conditions.
1.
2.
3.

Order cancellation
Order rejection
Refund

All the above situations would first be required to be enabled/ flagged on the GeM
Platform for the NPAE to be able to act accordingly.
4. While procuring goods & services through GeM, the NPAEs should credit 100% of the
projected Contract Value in case of Goods Contract in their GeM Pool Account before award
of contract. In cases of Services, amount should be credited for one payment cycle as
defined in the contract and before releasing payment for any cycle, the funds required for the
next payment cycle should be credited so as to ensure availability of payable funds for the
next payment cycle. Payment so credited will not be withdrawn for any other purpose other
than the one for which the amount is credited into GeM Pool Account.
5. After placement of contract on GeM, the process for PRC and CRAC will be same for
NPAE category also as indicated in Para 4.17.7 (vi) (A) (9) above regarding Provisional
Receipt of Stores on GeM and Para 4.17.7 (vi) (A) (10) Consignee Receipt and Acceptance
of Stores on GeM for PFMS Buyers.
6. After issue of CRAC, NPAE Nodal Officer shall issue an advice without delay to the bank
to release actual amount payable to Seller/ Service Provider as per terms of contract from
the GeM Pool Account. On authorization, the bank should transfer the prescribed amount to
the Seller/Service Provider supplier mapped in the transaction.
7. In case of a Service level agreement (SLA) breach on the part of the NPAE in terms of
payments to the Seller/Service Provider, GeM will intimate the buyer and bank of the same.
Post such intimation, and non-action on the part of the NPAE with respect to payment
transfer, bank will release payments for the delivery of goods at consignee destination/
milestone achievement (such as completion of installation/ commissioning or training etc. as
defined in the contract)/ service delivery as notified in the terms and conditions of
procurement on GeM to the Seller/ Service Provider mapped in the transaction. Such a
provision is required to be incorporated in GPA and should be considered as a standing
instruction from the NPAE to the bank. The residual amount cannot be withdrawn/
transferred by the NPAE, in such cases.
8. In case, even after 10 days of issue of Consignee receipt and acceptance certificate
(CRAC)/ auto generated CRAC , the buyer has not initiated the payment process through

88

the GeM platform, a payment trigger will be automatically generated for payment equivalent
to 80% of the corresponding quantity/ milestone achievement/ service delivery deduced by
the system as per CRAC. Simultaneously intimation will be sent to the HoD, buyer and
NPAE Nodal officer for GeM, regarding the release of payment, at their risk and cost in line
with the terms and condition (T&C) and SLA of procurement on GeM. The residual payment
of 20% is to be processed by the buyer within 35 days after adjusting for any statutory
deduction and damages, failing which after 35 days, the same will be released to the Seller/
Service Provider automatically through an alert to the bank by the GeM Platform, after
statutory deductions and any system know deductions.
9. Unutilized funds after closure of the Contract and interest accrued on the credited amount
will be at the disposal of nominated NPAE Nodal officer, who may advise banker for further
action as deemed fit.
10. The Steering Committee on GeM of each Ministry should monitor the implementation of
these instructions regarding operationalization of GeM Pool Account.
11. Ministries/ Departments of Government of India are accordingly requested to issue
necessary instructions to all Non-PFMS Agencies/ Entities under their control.
vii)

In case any Non PFMS Agency/ Entity decides with the approval of their Competent
Authority to have integration of their on-line payment Systems with functionality for
Blocking of Funds etc. as per PFMS system of payments, the Payment procedures
outlined for PFMS in Para 4.17.7 (vi) (A) shall be mutatis mutandis applicable to
them.

viii)

Currently, for unlocking of funds, especially during the fag end of the financial year,
buyers need to send emails etc. to GeM. Thereafter, GeM manually unlocks the
payments. GeM will automate this whole process.

4.17.8
It is mandatory for a buyer to generate a “GeM Availability Report and Past
Transaction Summary” (GeMAR&PTS) 59 with a unique ID on GeM portal using his login
credentials on GeM for procurement outside GeM (for example for procurement through
Central Public Procurement Portal). The Past Transaction Summary will be provided, where
available. “GeMAR&PTS” shall be a pre-requisite for arriving at a decision by the competent
authority for procurement of required goods and services by floating a bid outside GeM and
its unique ID would be required to be furnished on the publishing portal along with the tender
proposed to be published.
4.17.9
Purchase of goods without quotation can be resorted for value upto Rs.
25,000/-only on each occasion may be made without inviting quotations or bids on the basis
of a certificate to be recorded by the competent authority, only when the required goods are
not available on GeM.
4.17.10
In case a certain item is not available on the GeM portal,]60Purchase of goods
costing above [Rs.25,000 (Rupees twenty five thousand only) and upto Rs.2,50,000/(Rupees two lakh and fifty thousand only)] on each occasion may be made on the

Chapter 5: Preparing bid documents, publication, receipt and
opening of bids
5.1

Preparation of Bid Documents

5.1.1 The text of the bid document should be self-contained and comprehensive without
any ambiguity. All essential information, which a bidder needs for sending responsive bid,
should be clearly spelt out in the bidding document in simple language. This will also enable
the prospective bidders to formulate and send their competitive bids with confidence. A
carefully prepared tender document avoids delays and complaints. Hence, it is worth
spending time and effort on this even in cases of urgency.
Bid documents should be based on SBDs relevant for the value range and the category of
procurement. SBD for e-procurement would be slightly different from the traditional SBD. To
ensure uniformity, the standard provisions in most sections of the SBD/ SRfPD are to be
used unaltered. Any modification to suit a unique requirement of the specific procurement in
these documents is to be done through variable sections such as Special Instructions to
Bidders or special conditions of contract (these variable sections may have different
nomenclatures in some organisations). Department of Expenditure has issued Model Tender
Documents for Procurement of Goods62 and Procurement of Non-Consultancy Services63 on
29th October 2021.
In case of a limited tender, instead of a full set of SBD, only a machine numbered tender
form (refer Annexure 5) is used as the tender document, after filling up the name of the
vendor and details of requirements. It has the “terms and conditions of tender” printed on the
obverse side. In any case, all registered vendors, who normally are invited to quote in such
limited tenders, have already acknowledged acceptance of “general conditions of contract”
as part of the registration application, which are applicable to such procurements, in
additions to “terms and conditions of tender” on the obverse of tender form. If necessary,
specifications and drawings or any other document may be enclosed with the limited tender
form.
While SBDs would be complete in themselves and may be slightly different for various
categories of procurements, these must necessarily address the following essential aspects:
i)

Description of the subject matter of procurement, its specifications including the
nature, quantity, time and place or places of delivery;

ii)

Limitation or preference for participation by bidders in terms of the Government
policies;

iii)

The criteria for eligibility and qualification to be met by the bidder (the eligibility
criteria should take care of the supplier’s eligibility to receive such a Government

performance, experience, technical competence and production capacity of the
subject goods, financial strength to handle the contract successfully, compliance with
environmental protection regulations/ Environment Management System and so on);
iv)

There are no such qualifications for the bidders that would be advantageous to the

Tender Documents :

a) The tender document is the fundamental document in the public procurement process as
after award of the contract it becomes part of the contract agreement. All necessary
provisions governing the contract should be clearly provided in the tender document.
Examples are technical specifications, drawings, commercial terms and conditions
including time period, inspection, payment terms, obligations of the procuring entity and
the suppliers timeframe/ milestones, tax implications, compliance framework for statutory
and other norms, dispute resolution. Provisions/ clauses in the tender document should
be clear to avoid differences in interpretation and possible time overrun, cost overrun
and quality compromises. Model Tender Documents issued by the DoE may be used,
with due customisation.
b) In tenders containing General Conditions of Contract (GCC), additional/ special
conditions to be incorporated in the tender document, shall be need based and specific.

procurement process. They shall be clear and fair, having regard to the specific
circumstances of the procurement. Appropriate parameters should be prescribed in the
eligibility criteria for bidders, to enable selection of the right type of bidders in public
interest, balancing considerations of quality, time and cost.
f) Open online tendering should be the default method to ensure efficiency of procurement.
Public authorities should also keep the experience criteria broad based so that bidders
with experience in similar nature of items/ goods can participate.
g) Pre-bid conference may be conducted for large value tenders by Procuring Entities. The
Place and time of pre-bid conferences should be mentioned in the tender document and/
or publicized through the website of the procuring entity and/ or through newspaper

The main sections of the SBD are:
i)

Notice Inviting Tender (NIT);

ii)

Instructions to Bidders (ITB);

iii)

Appendix to Instructions to Bidders (AITB) (instead of modifying ITB, it is better to

Schedule of requirements

vi)

Technical specifications (including Drawings) and Quality Assurance (Inspections
and Tests);

vii)

General Conditions of Contract (GCC);

contract format.

A reading of the sections of the tender document will make the purpose and instructions
clear. However, some broad guidelines for preparing bid documents are provided in the
subsequent paragraphs.
5.1.3

Notice Inviting Tender

The model NIT format in SBD should be used for publishing the tender notice. To ensure
competition, attention of all likely tenderers, for example, registered suppliers, past suppliers
and other known potential suppliers, should be invited to the NIT through email/SMSs/
letters. In e-procurement, the website may be programmed to generate these alerts
automatically.
The Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) is crucial for attracting wide competition in the tender. The
model NIT format in SBD should be used for publishing the tender notice. The NIT should be
brief but must contain sufficient detail for a prospective bidder to decide whether to
participate in the tender or not and, if he decides to participate, how to go about it. To ensure
competition, attention of all likely tenderers, for example, registered vendors, past suppliers

93

and other known potential suppliers, should be invited to the NIT through email/ SMSs/
letters. In e-procurement, the website may be programmed to generate these alerts
automatically. NIT should be published as per the current policy of Procuring Entity in this
regard (Please refer to chapter 4 for details).
In case of procurement through a limited tender, the NIT may be uploaded on CPPP Portal
and Procuring Entity’s website with a note saying:
“This notice is being published for information only and is not an open invitation to quote in
this limited tender. Participation in this tender is by invitation only and is limited to the
selected Procuring Entity’s registered suppliers. Unsolicited offers are liable to be ignored.
However, suppliers who desire to participate in such tenders in future may apply for
registration with Procuring Entity as per procedure.”
Printouts of the tenders published on the website should be collected and kept on record as
a proof of publicity. The complete details of the dates, on which advertisements actually
appeared on the website, should be indicated while sending cases to higher authorities.
5.1.4

Information to Bidders (ITB) and AITB

ITB contain all relevant information as well as guidance to the prospective tenderers
regarding all aspects of obtaining tender documents, and preparing and submitting a
responsive bid. It also mentions the process of establishing the eligibility of the tenderer as
well as evaluation and comparison of tenders and award of contract. ITB should not contain
information on processes after the announcement of the award which should be covered in
GCC, for example, the arbitration clause, resolution of disputes, and so on. Instead of
modifying ITB every time, any changes warranted by special circumstances may be
indicated with the prior approval of CA on a separate Appendix to ITB (AITB) and ITB may
be included unchanged in every tender document. It should also to be indicated therein that
the provisions in the AITB will supersede the corresponding provisions in the ITB.
Important clauses of ITB/ AITB which may require attention and action are:
i)

Purchase Preference Policies
If the purchaser intends to give a purchase preference in line with current
Government policies, this fact must be declared in the ITB/AITB and in NIT as well.

ii)

Clarification of Tender Documents
A prospective bidder requiring clarification on the tender documents may notify to
Procuring Entity in writing, well before the due date of submission of bids, and a
response will be sent in writing to the clarifications sought prior to the date of opening
of the tenders. Copies of the query and clarification shall be sent to all prospective
bidders who have received the tender documents.

iii)

Amendment of Tender Documents (Rule 173 (iii) of GFR 2017)
At any time prior to the date of submission of bids, the purchaser may, whether at his
own initiative or in response to a clarification sought by a prospective bidder, amend
bid documents by issuing a corrigendum. The corrigendum shall be notified in writing
by registered post/speed post/courier/email to all known prospective bidders. Copies
of such amendments are also to be prominently attached in the unsold sets of the
tender documents (which are available for sale), including the tender documents

94

uploaded on the website. When the amendment/modification changes the
requirement significantly and /or when there is not much time left for the tenderers to
respond to such amendments, and prepare a revised tender, the time and date of
submission of tenders are also to be extended suitably, along with suitable changes
in the corresponding timeframes for receipt of the tender, tender validity period, and
so on, and validity period of the corresponding EMD/bid security. Depending on the
situation, such an amendment may also need fresh publication adopting the same
procedure as for publication of the original tender enquiry.
iv)

Bid Validity

2.3.1 A bid shall remain valid for the period mentioned in the ITB/ AITB [normally 75
(seventy-five) days for OTE and 90 (ninety) days for GTE]. In exceptional
circumstances, the consent of the bidder may be requested in writing for an
extension to the period of bid validity. Such requests should preferably be made
much before the expiry of the bid validity. The bid security provided shall also be
suitably extended. A bidder accepting the request and granting extension shall
not be permitted to modify his bid. Reasons for seeking extension of bid validity
should be recorded by the procuring officers at the time of taking such decisions
itself.
v)

Sealing and Marking of Tenders
The tender document is to indicate the total number of tender sets (for example, in
duplicate or in triplicate, and so on) required to be submitted. The tenderer is to seal
the original and each copy of the tender in separate envelopes, duly marking the
same as "original", "duplicate," and so on, and also printing the address of the
purchase office and the tender reference number on the envelopes. Further, the
sentence ''NOT TO BE OPENED" before (due date and time of tender opening) is
also to be printed on these envelopes. The inner envelopes are then to be put inside
a bigger outer envelope, which will also be duly sealed marked, and so on, as above.
If the outer envelope is not sealed and marked properly as above, the purchaser will
not assume any responsibility for its misplacement, premature opening, late opening,
and so on. All the above instructions are to be suitably incorporated in the tender
documents.

vi)

Withdrawal, Substitution and Modification of Tenders
The tenderer, after submitting the tender, is permitted to withdraw, substitute or
modify the tenders in writing without forfeiture of Bid Security/ EMD, provided these
are received duly sealed and marked like the original tender, up to the date and time
of receipt of the tender. Any such request received after the prescribed date and time
of receipt of tenders will not be considered. No bid may be withdrawn in the interval
between the deadline for submission of bids and expiration of the period of bid
validity. Withdrawal of a bid during this period will result in forfeiture of the bidder’s
bid security (EMD) and other sanctions.

vii)

Eligibility/Evaluation/Qualification Criteria
If it is intended to use eligibility/evaluation/qualification criteria to evaluate a tender
and determine whether a tenderer has the required qualifications, this point may be
clearly specified in NIT, ITB/AITB or as a separate section of the tender document.

95

The bidder has to ensure that he provides convincing proof of having fulfilled these
criteria. Any criteria not specified in the tender cannot be used for evaluation or
qualification.
The condition of prior turnover and prior experience may be relaxed for Startups (as
defined by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion) subject to meeting of
quality & technical specifications and making suitable provisions in the bidding
document (Rule 173 (i) of GFR 2017). As per Department of Expenditure’s OM
No.F.20/2/2014-PPD dated 20.09.2016, relaxation regarding the prior turnover and
prior experience is applicable only to all startups recognized by Department of
Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) subject to meeting of quality and technical
specifications. Startups may be MSMEs or otherwise.
Prequalification/ Post Qualification (PQ) shall be based entirely upon the capability
and resources of prospective bidders to perform the particular contract satisfactorily,
taking into account their experience and past performance, capabilities with respect
to personnel, equipment and manufacturing facilities, financial standing. The quantity,
delivery and value requirement shall be kept in view, while fixing the PQ criteria. No
bidder should be denied prequalification/post qualification for reasons unrelated to its
capability and resources to successfully perform the contract.
viii)

OEM/Authorised Dealer/Agents of Supplier
Except in case of Commercially-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) items, when a firm sends
quotation for an item manufactured by some different company, the firm is also
required to attach, in its quotation, the manufacturer's authorisation certificate and
also manufacturer's confirmation of extending the required warranty for that product
as per formats given in SBD. This is necessary to ensure quotation from a
responsible party offering genuine product, also backed by a warranty obligation from
the concerned manufacturer. In the tender, either the manufacturer or its authorised
dealer can be considered as valid bidders.
In case of large contracts, especially capital equipment, the manufacturer’s
authorisation must be insisted upon on a tender specific basis, not general
authorisation/dealership, by so declaring in the bid documents clearly.
In cases where the manufacturer has submitted the bid, the bids of its authorised
dealer will not be considered and EMD will be returned.
And in case of violations, both infringing bids will be rejected.

ix)

Conflict of Interest among Bidders/ Agents
A bidder shall not have conflict of interest with other bidders. Such conflict of interest
can lead to anti-competitive practices to the detriment of Procuring Entity’s interests.
The bidder found to have a conflict of interest shall be disqualified. A bidder may be
considered to have a conflict of interest with one or more parties in this bidding
process, if:
a) they have controlling partner (s) in common; or
b) they receive or have received any direct or indirect subsidy/ financial stake
from any of them; or
c) they have the same legal representative/agent for purposes of this bid; or

96

d) they have relationship with each other, directly or through common third
parties, that puts them in a position to have access to information about or
influence on the bid of another Bidder; or
e) Bidder participates in more than one bid in this bidding process. Participation
by a Bidder in more than one Bid will result in the disqualification of all bids in
which the parties are involved. However, this does not limit the inclusion of the
components/ sub-assembly/ Assemblies from one bidding manufacturer in
more than one bid.
f)

In cases of agents quoting 64 in offshore procurements, on behalf of their
principal manufacturers, one agent cannot represent two manufacturers or
quote on their behalf in a particular tender enquiry. One manufacturer can also
authorise only one agent/dealer. There can be only one bid from the following:
1. The principal manufacturer directly or through one Indian agent on his
behalf; and
2. Indian/foreign agent on behalf of only one principal.

g) a Bidder or any of its affiliates participated as a consultant in the preparation of
the design or technical specifications of the contract that is the subject of the
Bid;
h) In case of a holding company having more than one independently
manufacturing units, or more than one unit having common business
ownership/management, only one unit should quote. Similar restrictions would
apply to closely related sister companies. Bidders must proactively declare
such sister/ common business/ management units in same/ similar line of
business.
x)

Schedule of Requirements
This section comprises the list of goods and delivery schedule. If there is no separate
TS, then TS, quality assurance and inspections may also be included here. If the
tender contains a number of schedules of requirements, it must be clarified, whether
evaluation of eligibility/qualifications/financial bids would be on a schedule by
schedule basis or on the basis of a total of all schedules put together.

xi)

Quotation Received from Dealers/Agents for Items not Manufactured by Them
When a firm sends a quotation for an item manufactured by a different company, the
firm is also required to attach in its quotation that manufacturer's authorisation
certificate and also manufacturer's confirmation of extending the required warranty
for that product (in addition to the tenderers' confirmation to the required warranty). If
the firm is an authorised agent/dealer of that manufacturer, certified documentary
evidence to this effect is to be attached along with the quotation. This is necessary to
ensure a quotation from a responsible party offering the genuine product, also
backed by a warranty obligation from the concerned manufacturer.

64

CVC (CTE) No.12-02-6-CTE/SPI (1)-2, dated January 13, 2012 refers to this.

97

xii)

Special Conditions in GTE Procurements
a) Currency of Bidding: In GTE tenders, the Foreign Bidders are allowed to
quote price (and get paid) in RBI’s notified basket of foreign currencies - US
Dollar or Euro or Pound Sterling or Yen etc., in addition to the Indian Rupees
- except for expenditure incurred in India (including agency commission if
any) which should be stated in Indian Rupees. Indian Bidders are to quote in
INR only.
b) Agency Commission: The amount of Agency Commission, (normally not
exceeding five percent) payable to the Indian Agent should not be more than
what is specified in the Agency agreement (a certified copy should be
submitted along with the bid) between the bidder and the Indian Agent. The
Indian Agent will be required to submit a certificate along with their Agency
Commission bill, confirming that the amount claimed as Agency Commission
in the bill has been spent/will be spent, strictly to render services to the
foreign Principal, in terms of the Agency Agreement. The Purchaser or their
authorized agencies and/or any other authority of the Government of India
shall have rights to examine the books of the Indian Agent and defects or
misrepresentations in respect of the afore indicated confirmation coming to
light during such examinations will make the foreign Principal (i.e. the
Contractor) and their Indian Agent liable to be banned/suspended from
having business dealings with the Purchaser, following laid down procedures
for such banning/suspension of business dealings.
c) Delivery Terms: The delivery terms are to be expressed in terms of
Incoterms. Asper the revised policy 65 of the Government, all Public
Procurement import contracts involving (Ocean freight of dry or liquid bulk
cargoes) are to be finalized only on FOB (Free on Board)/ FAS (Free
Alongside Ship) basis and in case of any departure there-from, prior approval
of the concerned administrative Ministry/ Department may be obtained.
However imports involving ocean freight of general liner: cargoes, project
cargoes, heavy lift, container, break bulk cargoes etc. can now be made on
FOB (Free on Board)/ FAS (Free Alongside Ship) or CFR (Cost & Freight)/
CIF(Cost, Insurance & Freight) basis. All importing Government
Departments/ PSUs are now allowed to make their own shipping
arrangements with out needing to route their requirements through
Chartering Wing of Ministry of Shipping. As per the extant directive of the
Government, airlifting of imported goods from abroad will be done only
through the national carrier, that is, Air India, wherever applicable. However,
before processing any contract involving import of goods through air,
contemporary instructions in this regard may be ascertained and followed;
and
d) Insurance: Wherever necessary, the goods supplied under the contract shall
be fully insured in a freely convertible currency against loss or damage

65

http://shipping.nic.in/showfile.php?lid=2098

98

incidental to manufacture or acquisition, transportation, storage and delivery
in the manner specified in the contract. If considered necessary, the
insurance may be done for coverage on an "all risks" basis including war
risks and strike clauses. The amount to be covered under insurance should
be sufficient to take care of the overall expenditure to be incurred by the
purchaser for receiving the goods at the destination. Insurance of imported
goods/equipment would need to be arranged on a very selective basis and
only for cases where the value of individual shipment is expected to be in
excess of Rupees five crore. Procuring Entities who are entering into large
number of imports contracts, may enter into annual Insurance arrangements
for all imports during the year with Insurance Companies, instead of
insurance for each individual imports separately on the basis of “Open Cover
(all Risk)”. Where delivery of imported goods is required by the purchaser on
Cost Insurance and Freight/Carriage and Insurance Paid (CIF/CIP) basis, the
supplier shall arrange and pay for marine/air insurance, making the
purchaser the beneficiary. Where delivery is on Free On Board/ Free
Alongside Ship (FOB/FAS) basis, marine/air insurance shall be the
responsibility of the purchaser
5.1.5

General and Special Conditions of the Contract

The GCC to be used for contracting for procurement are provided in Procuring Entity’s SBD.
GCC covers all information on aspects after the announcement of the tender award till the
closure of the contract and dispute resolution. It should not cover any aspect up to
announcement of award. Instead of modifying the GCC every time, any changes warranted
by special circumstances may be indicated in a separate SCC with the prior approval of the
CA and GCC may be included unchanged in every tender document. It is also to be
indicated therein that the provisions in the SCC will supersede the corresponding provisions
in the GCC.
5.1.6

Submission Formats

This section contains the relevant forms for tender submission: various declarations by
tenderer, formats for the bank guarantee, price schedule forms, exception and deviation
forms, contract forms and manufacture’s authorisation form, and so on.
5.1.7

Mandatory e-Publishing of Tenders (Rule 159 of GFR 2017)

It is mandatory for all Ministries/Departments of the Central Government, their attached and
subordinate offices and autonomous/statutory bodies to publish their tender enquiries,
corrigenda thereon and details of bid awards on the Central Public Procurement Portal
(CPPP) 66 . These instructions apply to all Tender Enquiries, Requests for Proposals,
Requests for Expressions of Interest, Notice for pre Qualification/ Registration or any other
notice inviting bids or proposals in any form whether they are advertised, issued to limited

number of parties or to a single party. These instructions would not apply to Purchase of
goods without quotations or Purchase of goods by purchase committee.
Individual cases where confidentiality is required, for reasons of national security, would be
exempted from the mandatory e-publishing requirement. The decisions to exempt any case
on the said grounds should be approved by the Secretary of the Ministry/ Department with
the concurrence of the concerned Financial Advisor. In the case of autonomous bodies and
Statutory bodies’ approval of the head of the body with the concurrence of the head of the
finance should be obtained in each such case. Statistical information on the number of cases
in which exemption was granted and the value of the concerned contract should be intimated
on a Quarterly basis to the Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure.

5.2

Receipt and Custody of Tenders

5.2.1 Cost and Availability of Tender Documents
Tender documents should preferably be sold or available for download up to date of opening
of tenders and this should be clearly indicated in the documents. The organisation should
also post the complete tender document in the website and permit prospective tenderers to
make use of the document downloaded from the website.
The tender document fee should be as low as possible considering the cost/effort of
preparing documents. In order to promote wider participation and ease of bidding, no cost of
tender document may be charged for the tender documents downloaded by the bidders. The
procuring Entity may decide not to take any charges for the tender documents, in view of
prevalence of e-publishing/ downloading of tender documents. The cost of the tender
document is to be submitted to the authority nominated therein by the prospective tenderer
in the form of a demand draft /banker’s cheque/pay order. Firms that are eligible for
exemption from the tender document fee such as MSEs, Procuring Entity registered units
(for relevant items and monetary limit) have to submit/upload scanned copy of documents in
support of this exemption. Although the Procuring Entity is the best judge to decide or waive
the document cost, following table could be used as a starting point:

5.2.2

Pre-bid Conference(Rule 173 (x) of GFR 2017)

In case of turnkey contract (s) and facilities of a special nature for procurement of
sophisticated and costly equipment, large works and complex consultancy assignments, a
suitable provision is to be kept in the bidding documents for one or more pre-bid conference
for clarifying issues/clearing doubts, if any, about the specifications and other allied
technical/commercial details of the plant, equipment and machinery projected in the bidding
document and for ensuring that the technical requirements provide a level playing field. The
date, time and place of the pre-bid conference should be indicated in the tender enquiry

100

document. Bidders should be asked to submit written queries in advance of the conference.
After the conference, the techno-commercial requirements may be revised if considered
necessary by way of issue of a formal corrigendum (mere minutes of the meeting of pre-bid
conference would not suffice) and shared with all the bidders who purchase or have
purchased the bid documents.
5.2.3

Extension of Tender Opening Date

Sometimes, situations may arise necessitating modification of the tender documents already
issued (LTE case) or already put on sale (OTE case). Also, after receiving the documents, a
tenderer may point out some genuine mistakes necessitating amendment in the tender
documents. In such situations, it is necessary to amend/modify the tender documents
suitably prior to the date of submission of bids. Copies of such amendment / modification
should be simultaneously sent to all the selected suppliers by registered/speed
post/courier/e-mail in case of LTE. In case of OTE, the copies of such amendment /
modification are to be simultaneously despatched, free of cost, by registered/speed
post/courier/e-mail, to all the parties who have already purchased the tender documents and
copies of such amendments are also to be prominently attached in the unsold sets of the
tender documents (which are available for sale), including the tender documents for
downloading put on the CPPP and Procuring Entity’s own website.
When the amendment/ modification changes the requirement significantly and/or when there
is not much time left for the tenderers to respond to such amendments, and prepare revised
tender, the time and date of submission of tenders are also to be extended suitably, along
with suitable changes in the corresponding time-frames for receipt of tender, tender validity
period etc and validity period of the corresponding EMD/bid security. Depending on the
situation, such an amendment may also need fresh publication adopting the same procedure
as for publication of the original tender enquiry.
5.2.4

Sealing, and Marking of Bids by Bidders

The tender document is to indicate the total number of tender sets (e.g., in duplicate or in
triplicate etc.) required to be submitted. In case of two envelop bidding system, the technocommercial bid and financial bid should be sealed by the tenderer in separate covers duly
marking these as ‘Techno-commercial Bid’ and ‘Financial Bid’ and marked these with the
address of the purchase office and the tender reference number on the envelopes. Further,
the sentence ‘’NOT TO BE OPENED” before……….. (due date & time of tender opening)
are also to be put on these envelopes and these sealed covers are to be put in a bigger
cover which should also be sealed and duly super scribed in a similar manner. In case bids
are asked in a number of copies, the tenderer is to seal the original and each copy of the
tender in separate envelopes, duly marking the same as “original”, “duplicate” and so on and
also marking these as mentioned above. The inner envelopes are then to be put in a bigger
outer envelope, which will also be duly sealed marked etc. as above. If the outer envelope is
not sealed and marked properly as above, the purchaser will not assume any responsibility
for its misplacement, premature opening, late opening etc. These details regarding the
submission of bids should also form a part of the ITB and AITB in the tender documents; all
the above instructions are to be suitably incorporated in the tender documents.
5.2.5

Submission, Receipt and Custody of Tenders

In e-procurement, all tenders uploaded by tenderers are received, safeguarded and opened
online on the portal. In offline tenders, receipt and custody of bids shall be done in a

101

transparent manner to maintain the credibility of the process. The following guidelines should
be adhered to for receipt and custody of bids:

1) The procuring entity shall maintain tender boxes for receiving the bids at suitable
locations which would facilitate security and easy access to bidders. If required, Tender
boxes should be separate for each day of the week of tender opening and should be
sealed by the Bid Opening Committee (BOC) of the day. The tender box shall have two
locks. Key of one lock will be with the head of the office and the other key with the official
nominated by him;

2) Bids received by courier shall be deposited in the tender box by the Dispatch Section till
the date and time of bid opening. Bids sent by telex, cable or facsimile are to be ignored
and rejected.; and

3) For bulky/oversized bids which cannot be dropped into tender boxes, the officials
authorised to receive such bids shall maintain proper records and provide a signed
receipt with date and time to the bearer of the bid. He will also sign on the cover, duly
indicating the date and time of receipt of the tender(s). Names and designations of at
least two such authorised officers should be mentioned in the bid documents
5.2.6

Withdraw/ Amendments / Modifications to Bids by Bidders

The tenderer, after submitting its tender, is permitted to withdraw/ alter/modify its tender so
long such withdrawal/ alterations/ modifications are received duly sealed and marked like
original tender, up to the date & time of receipt of tender. Any withdrawal/ amendment/
modification received after the prescribed date & time of receipt of tenders are not to be
considered.

5.3

Procedures to be followed during Bid Opening

Immediately after the deadline for bid submission, procuring entity shall proceed to the bid
opening. In e-procurement, bids are opened online as detailed in Appendix 3. In offline
tenders, the BOC shall comprise one officer each from the procuring entity and Associated/
integrated Finance.
i)

The authorised representatives of bidders, who intend to attend the tender opening in
OTE/ GTE/ SLTE are to bring with them letters of authority from the corresponding
bidder. The prescribed format for the letter of authority for attending the bid opening
should be given in the bidding document. All bid-opening activities should be carried
out demonstrably before such a gathering. The prescribed format for the bid opening
attendance sheet and report are given at Annexure 10;

ii)

At a prescheduled date and time, the BOC of the day should get the particular tender
box opened, after ensuring and demonstrating that the seal on the box has not been
tampered with. All bids should be collected from the tender box. Bids for tenders not
opening on that day should be put back into the box and the box resealed.
Sometimes, there would be tenders dropped wrongly into this tender box. Such
wrongly dropped tenders with appropriate endorsement should be put into the
appropriate box or sent to the Tender Committee (TC) concerned, if the date of
opening is over. The bids for different tenders opening on the day (including
oversized bids, which were submitted to designated officers) should be sorted, and a
count for each tender should be announced and recorded, particularly noting any

102

modifying/altering/withdrawal of bids. BOC should ensure and demonstrate that bid
envelopes are duly sealed and untampered. Late bids should be separately counted
but kept aside and not opened. In the case of an advertised tender enquiry or limited
tender enquiry, late bids (that is, bids received after the specified date and time for
receipt of bids) should not be considered (Rule 165 of GFR 2017);
iii)

After opening, every tender shall be numbered serially (say 3/14 – if it is the third bid

price schedule or letter attached to it shall also be similarly initialled, particularly the
prices, delivery period, and so on, which shall also be circled and initialled along with
the date. Any other page containing significant information should also be dealt with
similarly. Blank tenders, if any, should be marked accordingly by the BOC. The
original (and duplicate, if any) copies in a tender set are to be marked accordingly by
the BOC;

iv)

Erasure/cutting/overwriting/use of whitener/columns left unfilled in tenders, if any,
shall be initialled along with date and time and numbered by the officials opening the
tenders and total number of such noticed alterations (or the absence of any
alteration)should be explicitly marked on the first page of the bid. Wherever
quantity/amount is written only in figures, the BOC should write them in words. All
rebates/discounts should be similarly circled, numbered and signed. In the absence
of any alteration/overwriting/whitener/ blanks, the remark “no corrections noted”
should be written. Similarly, the absence of discounts should be marked with “no
discounts noted;”

v)

The BOC is to announce the salient features of the tenders such as description and
specification of the goods, quoted price, terms of delivery, delivery period, discount, if
any, whether EMD furnished or not, and any other special feature of the tender for
the information of the representatives attending the tender opening. No clarifications
by tenderers should be entertained or allowed to be recorded during the bid opening.
It should be understood that BOC has no authority to reject any tender at the tender
opening stage;

vi)

Proper sealing and codification need to be done on samples as well for samples
which accompany the bid. These should be kept for reference under lock and key.
Details should be recorded in the sample register maintained in the opening section.
Documents related to money should be noted in the bid opening report/register and
handed over to the Finance Section for safe custody and monitoring; and

vii)

A bid opening report containing the names of the tenderers (serial number wise),
salient features of the tenders, as read out during the public opening of tenders, will
be prepared by the tender opening officers, and duly signed by them along with the
date and time. The tenders that have been opened, list of the representatives
attending the tender opening, and bid opening report are to be handed over to the
nominated purchase officer and an acknowledgement obtained for him.

Variations
6.1

Forms of Security

6.1.1

Bid Security (Rule 170 of GFR 2017)

To safe guard against a bidder’s with drawing or altering its/ his bid during the bid validity
period in the case of advertised (OTE and GTE tenders) or limited tender enquiry Bid
Security [also known as Earnest Money Deposit (EMD)] is to be obtained from the bidders
along with their bids except Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) as defined in MSE
Procurement Policy issued by Department of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
or are registered with the Central Purchase Organisation or the concerned Ministry of
Department or Startups as recognized by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal
Trade (DPIIT). The bidders should be asked to furnish bid security along with their
bids67..Amount of bid security should ordinarily range between two to five per cent of the
estimated value of the goods to be procured. The amount of bid security, rounded off to the
nearest thousands of Rupees, as determined by the Procuring Entity, is to be indicated in
the bidding documents. The bid security may be obtained in the form of Insurance Surety
Bonds 68,account payee demand draft, fixed deposit receipt, or banker's cheque or Bank
Guarantee from any of the Commercial Banks or payment online in an acceptable form,
safeguarding the purchaser’s interest in all respects. . In case the bid security is more than
a threshold (Rupees five lakh) and in case of foreign bidders in GTE tenders it may be in
the form of a bank guarantee (in equivalent Foreign Exchange amount, in case of GTE)
issued/confirmed from any of the scheduled commercial bank in India in an acceptable form,
and so on.. The bid security is normally to remain valid for a period of 45( forty-five) days
beyond the final bid validity period.
In exceptional cases, in place of a Bid security, Procuring Entities after seeking approval of
the competent authority may consider asking Bidders to sign a Bid securing declaration
accepting that if they withdraw or modify their Bids during the period of validity, or if they are
awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract, or to submit a performance security
before the deadline defined in the request for bids/request for proposals document, they will
be suspended for the period of time specified in the request for bids/request for proposals
document from being eligible to submit Bids/Proposals for contracts with the procuring entity.
In appropriate cases, Submission of the bid security may be waived with the Competent
Authority’s (CA’s) approval, especially in the case of indigenisation/development tenders,
limited tenders and procurements directly from the manufacturer or authorised agents.
Tenderers that are currently registered will also continue to remain registered during the
tender validity period with the Procuring Entity or MSEs (please refer to para 1.10.4 of
Chapter 1) are exempt from payment of EMD. In case the tenderer falls in these categories,
the bidder should furnish a certified copy of its valid registration details. Except for MSEs,
this exemption is valid for the trade group and monetary value of registration only.

A bidder’s bid security will be forfeited if the bidder withdraws or amends its/his tender or
impairs or derogates from the tender in any respect within the period of validity of the tender
or if the successful bidder fails to furnish the required performance security within the
specified period.
Bid securities of the unsuccessful bidders should be returned to them at the earliest after
expiry of the final bid validity period and latest by the 30th day after the award of the contract.
Bid security should be refunded to the successful bidder on receipt of a performance
security. However, in case of two packet or two stage bidding, Bid securities of unsuccessful
bidders during first stage i.e. technical evaluation etc. should be returned within 30 days of
declaration of result of first stage i.e. technical evaluation etc.69

iii)

Performance Security (Rule 171 of GFR 2017)
To ensure due performance of the contract, performance security [or Performance
Bank Guarantee (PBG) or Security Deposit (SD)] is to be obtained from the
successful bidder awarded the contract. Unlike contracts of Works and Plants, in
case of contracts for goods, the need for the Performance Security depends on the
market conditions and commercial practice for the particular kind of goods.
Performance security should be for an amount of five (5) to ten (10) per cent of the
value of the contract as specified in the bid documents [The value has been reduced
to three (3) percent till 31.03.2023. Refer to para 6.1.2 (iv) below]. Performance
security may be furnished in the form of Insurance Surety Bond70, account payee
demand draft, fixed deposit receipt from a commercial bank, bank guarantee
issued/confirmed from any of the commercial bank in India, or online payment in an
acceptable form, safeguarding the purchaser's interest in all respects. In case of GTE
tenders, the performance security should be in the same currency as the contract
and must conform to Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG 758) – an
international convention regulating international securities71.Unlike, procurement of
Works, in procurement of Goods, the concept of taking part of Performance
Guarantee as money retained from first or progressive bills of the supplier is not
acceptable. Submission of Performance Security is not necessary for a contract
value uptoRupees1 (one)lakh.
Performance Security is to be furnished by a specified date (generally 14(fourteen)
days after notification of the award) and it should remain valid for a period of 60
(sixty) days beyond the date of completion of all contractual obligations of the
supplier, including warranty obligations.
The performance security will be forfeited and credited to the procuring entity’s
account in the event of a breach of contract by the contractor. It should be refunded
to the contractor without interest, after he duly performs and completes the contract
in all respects but not later than 60(sixty) days of completion of all such obligations

including the warranty under the contract. Return of Bid/ Performance Securities
should be monitored by the senior officers and delays should be avoided. If feasible,
the details of these securities may be listed in the e-Procurement Portal, so make the
process transparent and visible.
iv)
On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, that caused slowdown in economy, it is
decided to reduce Performance Security from existing five to ten percent to three (3) percent
of the value of the contract for all existing contracts till 31.03.2023. However, the benefit of
the reduced Performance Security will not be given in the contracts under dispute wherein
arbitration/ court proceedings have been already started or are contemplated. All tenders/
contracts issued/ concluded till 31.03.2023 should also have the provision of reduced
Performance Security. In all contracts, where Performance Security has been reduced to
three percent, the reduced percentage shall continue for the entire duration of the contract
and there should be no subsequent increase of Performance Security even beyond
31.03.2023. Similarly, in all contracts entered into with the reduced percentage of
Performance Security of three percent, there will be no subsequent increase in Performance
Security even beyond 31.03.2023. Where, there is compelling circumstances to ask for
Performance Security in excess of three percent as stipulated above, the same should be
done only with the approval of the next higher authority to the authority competent to finalise
the particular tender, or the Secretary of the Ministry/ Department, whichever is lower.
Specific reasons justifying the exception shall be recorded72.
6.1.3

Warranty Bank Guarantee

In case of works and capital equipment, there is usually a defect liability/warranty clause
against defects arising from design, material, workmanship or any omission on part of the
vendor/ contractor during a specified period of months from the date of commissioning or
from the date of dispatch in case of goods – whichever is earlier. In such cases, the
performance guarantee is to be valid upto 60 (sixty) days beyond the warranty period. It is
normally permissible in such a situation to allow Performance guarantee to be valid upto 60
(sixty) days beyond delivery/ commissioning period and the contractor may be allowed to
submit a fresh Warranty Bank Guarantee of 10 (ten) per cent of the value of the goods in the
currency of the contract valid upto 60 (sixty) days beyond the Warranty period. In such
cases, the performance guarantee is to be returned only after satisfactory delivery/
commissioning and receipt of such a warranty bank guarantee. In procurement of other than
Capital Equipment Goods (and in case of low value Capital Goods – say upto Rupees one
Lakh), Warranty Clause is not called for.
6.1.4 Verification of Bank Guarantees
Bank guarantees submitted by the tenderers/suppliers as EMD/performance securities need
to be immediately verified from the issuing bank before acceptance. There may not be any
need to get the Bank Guarantee vetted from legal/ finance authority if it is in the specified
format. Guidelines for verification of BGs submitted by the bidders/ contractors against EMD/
performance security/advance payments and for various other purposes are as follows:

BG shall be as per the prescribed formats
The BG contains the name, designation and code number of the Bank officer(s)
signing the guarantee(s);
The address and other details (including telephone no.) of the controlling officer of
the bank are obtained from the branch of the bank issuing the BG (this should be
included in all BGs);
The confirmation from the issuing branch of the bank is obtained in writing through
registered post/speed post/courier. The bank should be advised to confirm the
issuance of the BGs specifically quoting the letter of Procurement Entity on the
printed official letterhead of the bank indicating address and other details (including
telephone nos.) of the bank and the name, designation and code number of the
officer(s) confirming the issuance of the BG;
Pending receipt of confirmation as above, confirmation can also be obtained with the
help of responsible officer at the field office, which is close to the issuing branch of
the bank, who should personally obtain the confirmation from issuing branch of the
bank and forward the confirmation report to the concerned procurement entity.

Bank guarantees, either received in physical form or electronic form, should be verified for its
genuineness following prescribed method for the same and the Organisations should do due
diligence on genuineness of the Bank Guarantees before acceptance of the same.
6.1.5 Safe Custody and Monitoring of EMDs, Performance Securities and Other
Instruments
A suitable mechanism for safe custody and monitoring of EMDs and performance securities
and other instruments should be evolved and implemented by each ministry/Department.
The Ministries/ Departments shall also make institutional arrangements for taking all
necessary actions on time for extension or encashment or refund of EMDs and performance
securities, as the case may be. Monitoring should also include a monthly review of all bank
guarantees and other instruments expiring in next three months, along with a review of the
progress of the corresponding contracts. Extension of bank guarantees and other
instruments, where warranted, should be sought immediately and implemented within their
validity period. Bank Guarantee should never be handed over to the supplier for propose of
extension of validity. Such a system of monitoring of securities and other instruments may be
considered to be computerised with automatic alerts about lapse of validity etc.

6.2

Payment Clause

The elements of price included in the quotation of a tenderer depend on the nature of the
goods to be supplied and the allied services to be performed, location of the supplier,
location of the user, terms of delivery, extant rules and regulations about taxes, duties, and
so on, of the seller's country and the buyer's country.
In case of indigenous goods, the main elements of price may include raw material,
production cost, overhead, packing and forwarding charges, margin of profit, transit
insurance, excise duty and other taxes and duties as applicable. In case of imported goods,
in addition to similar elements of price as above (other than excise duty and taxes), there
may be elements of custom duty, import duty, landing and clearing charges and commission
to Indian agents. Further, depending on the nature of the goods (whether domestic or

108

imported), there may be cost elements towards installation and commissioning, operator's
training, and so on.
It is, therefore, necessary that, to enable the tenderers to frame their quotations properly in a
meaningful manner, the tender documents should clearly specify the desired terms of
delivery and also the duties and responsibilities to be performed by the supplier in addition to
supply of goods.
While claiming the payment, the supplier should also certify in the bill that the payment being
claimed is strictly in terms of the contract and all obligations on the part of the supplier for
claiming this payment have been fulfilled as required under the contract. There should also
be a suitable provision for verification of the authenticity of the person signing the invoice,
and so on, to claim the payment.
i)

Elements of Price: Where the price has several components such as the price of
the goods, cost of installation and commissioning, operators’ training, and so on,
bidders should be asked to furnish a cost break-up indicating the applicable prices
and taxes for each of such components along with the overall price. The payment
schedule and terms will be linked to this cost break-up; and

ii)

Currency: The tender documents are to specify the currency (currencies) in which
the tenders are to be priced. As a general rule, domestic tenderers are to quote and
accept their payment in Indian currency; Indian agents of foreign suppliers are to
receive their agency commission in Indian currency; costs of imported goods, which
are directly imported against the contract, may be quoted in foreign currency
(currencies) and paid accordingly in that currency; and the portion of the allied work
and services, which are to be undertaken in India (like installation and commissioning
of equipment) are to be quoted and paid in Indian currency.

iii)

Payment to Suppliers: In a supply contract, delivery of goods is the essence of the
contract for the purchaser. Similarly, receiving timely payment for the supplies is the
essence of the contract for the seller. A healthy buyer-supplier relationship is based
on the twin foundation of timely and quality supply, on the one hand, and prompt and
full payment to the supplier, on the other. It should be ensured that all payments due
to the firm, including release of the performance security, are made on a priority
basis without avoidable delay as per the tender/contract conditions. :
a) As far as possible, the payment terms and time schedule should be given in the
contract and must be adhered to. Any foreseeable payment delays should be
communicated to the suppliers in advance;
b) Prompt and timely provision of statutory certificates to the seller for taxes
deducted at source, are as much a part of payment as the amount actually
released. A detailed payment advice showing the calculations and reasons for
the amounts disallowed and taxes deducted must be issued to the supplier along
with payment. As soon as possible, but not later than the date of submission of
Tax returns, the procuring entity must provide the statutory certificates for the
taxes deducted to the Supplier, so that he is able to claim set-offs and refunds
from the concerned authorities.

109

c) Release of payment and settlement of the final bill should be processed through
the Associated/ integrated Finance as per the terms and conditions of the
contract;
d) No payments to contractors by way of compensation or otherwise outside the
strict terms of the contract or in excess of the contract rates should be allowed;
iv)

Before the payment is made, the invoice should be cross-checked with the actual
receipt of material/assets/services to ensure that the payment matches the actual
performance;

v)

While claiming the payment, the contractor must certify on the bill that the payment
being claimed is strictly within terms of the contract and all the obligations on his part
for claiming this payment have been fulfilled as required under the contract. There
should also be a suitable provision for verification of the authenticity of the person
signing the invoice, and so on, to claim the payment;

6.3

Terms of Payment for Domestic Goods

Where the terms of delivery are FOR Dispatching Station, the payment terms, depending on
the value and nature of the goods, mode of transportation, and so on, maybe60 to 90 (sixty
to ninety) per cent on proof of dispatch and other related documents and balance on receipt
at site and acceptance by the consignee.
Where the terms of delivery is FOR destination/delivery at site, the usual payment term is
100 (hundred) per cent on receipt and acceptance of goods by the consignee and on
production of all required documents by the supplier.
Where goods to be supplied also need installation and commissioning by the supplier, the
payment terms are generally:
i)

For a contract with terms of delivery as FOR dispatching station -- 60 (sixty) per cent
on proof of dispatch along with other specified documents, 30 (thirty) per cent on
receipt of the goods at site by the consignee and balance 10 (ten) per cent on
successful installation and commissioning and acceptance by the consignee; and

ii)

For a contract with terms of delivery as FOR destination/delivery at site -- 90 (ninety)
per cent on receipt and acceptance of goods by the consignee at destination and on
production of all required documents by the supplier and balance 10 (ten) per cent on
successful installation and commissioning and acceptance by the consignee.

Note: Generally (especially for goods requiring installation and commissioning at site by the
supplier), the desirable terms of delivery are FOR destination/delivery at site, so that the
supplier remains responsible for safe arrival of the ordered goods at the site. Therefore,
unless otherwise decided ex-works or FOR dispatching station terms should be avoided.
6.3.1

Modes of Payment for Domestic Goods

Payments to domestic suppliers are usually made by cheque/demand draft drawn on a
Government treasury or branch of RBI or any Scheduled Commercial Bank authorised by
RBI for transacting Government business. Such payment can also be made to the supplier's
bank, if the bills are endorsed in favour of the bank with a pre-receipt embossed on the bills
with the words, "received payment" and both the endorsement and pre-receipt are
authenticated by the supplier. In addition, an irrevocable power of attorney is to be granted

110

by the supplier in favour of the bank. In such of those cases where there has been global
tendering, in order to have uniform payment clauses, if domestic suppliers, especially
against high value contracts for sophisticated equipment/machinery, desire payment through
LC, depending on the merits of the case, this may be agreed to. However procuring entities
should switch over to more transparent electronic payment systems like Electronic
Clearance System (ECS), Real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) National Electronic
Funds Transfer (NEFT) or Electronic Payment Gateways.
6.3.2

Documents for Payment for Domestic Goods

i)

Supplier's Invoice indicating, inter alia description and specification of the goods,
quantity, unit price, total value;

ii)

Packing list;

iii)

Insurance certificate;

iv)

Railway receipt/consignment note;

v)

Manufacturer's guarantee certificate and in-house inspection certificate;

vi)

Inspection certificate issued by purchaser's inspector; and

vii)

Any other document(s) as and if required in terms of the contract.

6.4

Terms of Payment for Imported Goods

6.4.1

Usual payment terms, unless otherwise directed by CA, are indicated below:

i)

Cases where installation, erection and commissioning (if applicable) are not the
responsibility of the supplier -- 100 (hundred) per cent net FOB/FAS/CFR/CIF/CIP
price is to be paid against invoice, shipping documents, inspection certificate (where
applicable), manufacturers' test certificate, and so on;

ii)

Cases where installation, erection and commissioning are the responsibility of the
supplier -- 80 - 90 (eighty to ninety) per cent net FOB/FAS/CFR/CIF/CIP price will be
paid against the invoice, inspection certificate (where applicable), shipping
documents, and so on, and balance within 21-30 (twenty-one to thirty) days of
successful installation and commissioning at the consignee's premises and
acceptance by the consignee; and

iii)

Payment of agency commission, if payable, against FOB/FAS/CFR/CIF/CIP contract
– the entire 100 (hundred) per cent agency commission is generally paid (in nonconvertible Indian Rupees on the basis of BC selling rate of exchange) after all other
payments have been made to the supplier in terms of the contract.

6.4.2

Modes of Payment for Imported Goods

It should be ensured that the imports into India are in conformity with the export-import policy
in force: FEMA; FEMA (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000 framed by Procuring
Entity; and directions issued by RBI under FEMA from time to time.
For imported goods, payment usually happens through the LC opened by the State Bank of
India or any other scheduled/authorised bank as decided by the procuring entity. The
amount of LC should be equal to the total payable amount, and be released as per the
clauses mentioned above. Provisions of Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary

111

Credits73 should be adhered to while opening the LC for import into India. If the LC is not
opened, payment can also be made to the seller through a direct bank transfer for which the
buyer has to ensure that payment is released only after the receipt of prescribed documents.
6.4.3

Documents for Payment for Imported Goods

The documents, which are needed from the supplier for release of payment, are to be clearly
specified in the contract. The paying authority is also to verify the documents received from
the supplier with corresponding stipulations made in the contract before releasing the
payment. Documents, which the supplier is to furnish while claiming payment, are specified
in the Letter of Credit, but usually are:
Supplier's original invoice giving full details of the goods including quantity, value,
and so on;
ii) Packing list;
iii) Certificate of country of origin of the goods to be given by the seller or a recognised
chamber of commerce or another agency designated by the local Government for
this purpose;
iv) Certificate of pre-dispatch inspection by the purchaser's representative;
v) Manufacturer's test certificate and guarantee;
vi) Certificate of insurance;
vii) Bill of lading/airway bill/rail receipt or any other dispatch document, issued by a
Government agency (like the Department of Posts) or an agency duly authorised by
the concerned ministry/Department, indicating:
i)

a) Name of the vessel/carrier;
b) Bill of lading/airway bill;
c) Port of loading;
d) Date of shipment;
e) Port of discharge and expected date of arrival of goods; and
Any other document(s) as and if required in terms of the contract.
6.4.4

Air Freight Charges

Goods that are required to be airlifted are to be dispatched on a 'charge forward basis'. All
air freight charges, which are shown on the relevant consignment note as chargeable to the
consignee, are to be paid to the Airline in Rupees. Some organizations need to import
sophisticated instruments, tools and kindred goods. These are usually small in size and very
delicate/fragile in nature. Such goods, invariably, need to be airlifted. But, quite naturally,
form a small part of the Air Cargo carried by an Aircraft. For such imports, procuring entities
may engage Air Freight Consolidators who consolidate the small Air Cargos of different
customers, to be airlifted from one Airport to another. Hiring of services of Airfreight

112

Consolidators should be done in a transparent manner, following standard principles of
Public Procurement.
6.4.5

Letter of Credit

Two banks are involved in payment to the supplier by LC: – the purchaser's bank and
supplier's bank. The purchaser is to forward the request to its bank in the prescribed format
as formulated by the Bank, along with all relevant details including an authenticated copy of
the contract. Based on this, the purchaser's bank opens the LC on behalf of the purchaser
for transacting payment to the supplier through the supplier's bank. Care should be taken to
ensure that the payment terms and documents to be produced for receiving payments
through LC are identical with those shown in the contract. Generally, the irrevocable LC is
opened so that the supplier is fully assured of his payment on fulfilling his obligations in
terms of the contract. In case the delivery date of the contract is extended to take care of
delay in supply, for which the supplier is responsible, the tenure of the LC is also to be
extended, but the expense incurred for such an extension (of LC) is to be borne by the
supplier. Provisions of Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits (UCP 600)74
should be adhered to the while opening the LC for import into India.

6.5

Advance Payment

6.5.1 Ordinarily, payments for services rendered or supplies made should be released only
after the services have been rendered or supplies made. However, it may become
necessary to make advance payments in the following types of cases:
Advance payment demanded by firms holding maintenance contracts for servicing of
air-conditioners, computers, other costly equipment, etc.;
ii) Advance payment demanded by firms against fabrication contracts, turn-key
contracts; and so on;
Such advance payments should not exceed the following limits except in case of
procurement of arms and ammunitions from ordinance factories:
i)

a) Thirty per cent of the contract value to private firms;
b) Forty per cent of the contract value to a state or central Government agency or PSU;
or
c) In case of the maintenance contract, the amount should not exceed the amount
payable for six months under the contract.
d) In exceptional cases, the Administrative Department may relax the ceilings
mentioned above with prior concurrence of the Associated/ integrated Finance. While
making any advance payment as above, adequate safeguards in the form of a bank
guarantee, and so on, should be obtained from the firm. However, the bank
guarantee need not be insisted upon in case of procurement of arms and
ammunitions from ordinance factories. Further, such advance payments should be
generally interest bearing, suitable percentages for which are to be decided on a
case to case basis.

74

The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCPDC or simply UCP) is a set of rules regarding
techniques and methods for handling LCs in international trade finance which has been standardised by the International
Chamber of Commerce – the current version being the UCP600.

113

6.5.2

Documents for Advance Payments

Documents, needed from the supplier for release of payment, are to be clearly specified in
the contract. The paying authority should also verify the documents received from the
supplier with corresponding stipulations made in the contract before releasing the payment.
6.5.3

Insurance

In every case where advance payment or payment against dispatch documents is to be
made or LC is to be opened, the condition of insurance should invariably be incorporated in
the terms and conditions. Wherever necessary, the goods supplied under the contract, shall
be fully insured in a freely convertible currency against loss or damage incidental to
manufacture or acquisition, transportation, storage and delivery in the manner specified in
the contract. If considered necessary, insurance may cover "all risks" including war risks and
strike clauses. The amount to be covered under insurance should be sufficient to take care
of the overall expenditure to be incurred by the procuring entity for receiving the goods at the
destination. Where delivery of imported goods is required by the purchaser on CIF/CIP
basis, the supplier shall arrange and pay for marine/air insurance, making the purchaser the
beneficiary. Where delivery is on FOB/FAS basis, marine/air insurance shall be the
responsibility of the purchaser.
(Rule 172 of GFR 2017)

6.6

Firm Price vis-à-vis Variable Price

Short-term contracts where the delivery period does not extend beyond 18 (eighteen)
months should normally be concluded with a firm and price fixed by inviting tenders
accordingly. However, even for shorter deliveries, the PVC may be stipulated for items with
inputs (raw material, labour, etc.), prone to short-term price volatility - especially for critical or
high value items – otherwise there is a possibility of the contract failing or the purchaser
having to pay a higher price if prices fall. For high value (more than Rupees three crore)
tenders with deliveries longer than 18 (eighteen) months, PVC may be provided to protect
the purchaser’s interests also.
Where it is decided to conclude the contract with a variable price, an appropriate clause
incorporating, inter-alia, a suitable price variation formula should also be provided in the
tender documents, to calculate the price variation between the base level and scheduled
delivery date. It is best to proactively provide our own PVC in the tender document to
discourage different bidders quoting different formulae and different base dates, which may
lead to problems on bringing their prices on a common comparable footing.
The variations are to be calculated periodically by using indices published by Governments/
chambers of commerce/London Metal Exchange / any other neutral and fair source of
indices. Suitable weights are to be assigned to the applicable elements, that is, fixed
overheads and profits, material and labour in the price variation formula. If the production of
goods needs more than one raw material, the input cost of material may be further subdivided for different categories of material, for which cost indices are published.
The following are important elements of PVC:
i)

The price agreed upon should specify the base date, that is, the month and year to
which the price is linked to enable variations being calculated with reference to the
price indices prevailing in that month and year. The raw materials used in

114

manufacture are procured some weeks before the goods’ submission for inspection.
This period is called the time lag for price variation. It applies both for base date and
date of supply. This time lag at both ends must be specified;
ii)

The price variation formula must also stipulate a minimum percentage of variation of
the contract price, only above which the price variation will be admissible (for
example, where the resultant increase is lower than, say, two per cent of the contract
price, no price adjustment will be made in favour of the supplier);

iii)

The price variation clause should provide for a ceiling on price variations, particularly
where escalations are involved. It could be a percentage per annum or an overall
ceiling or both;

iv)

Where advance or stage payments are made there should be a further stipulation
that no price variations will be admissible on such portions of the price, after the
dates of such payment;

v)

Where deliveries are accepted beyond the scheduled delivery date subject to levy of
liquidated damages as provided in the contract. The LD (if a percentage of the price)
will be applicable on the price as varied by the operation of the PVC;

vi)

No upward price variation will be admissible beyond the original scheduled delivery
date for defaults on the part of the supplier. However, a downward price variation
would be availed by the purchaser as per the denial clause in the letter of extension
of the delivery period;

vii)

Price variation may be allowed beyond the original scheduled delivery date, by
specific alteration of that date through an amendment to the contract in cases of
force majeure or defaults by Government;

viii)

Where contracts are for supply of equipment, goods, and so on, imported (subject to
customs duty and foreign exchange fluctuations) and/or locally manufactured
(subject to excise duty and other duties and taxes), the percentage and element of
duties and taxes included in the price should be specifically stated, along with the
selling rate of foreign exchange element taken into account in the calculation of the
price of the imported item;

ix)

The clause should also contain the mode and terms of payment of the price variation
admissible; and

x)

The buyer should ensure a provision in the contract for the benefit of any reduction in
the price in terms of the PVC being passed on to him.

xi)

An illustrative PVC clause is available in Annexure 15.

xii)

Care should be exercised in contracts providing for price variation to finalise the price
before final payment is made, after obtaining data and documents in support of
claims for escalation, if any. Where no such claims are submitted by the suppliers, an
examination of whether there has been a downward trend in the cost, which the
contractor may not bring out, is required. At any rate, an undertaking should be
obtained from the contractor to the following effect in case it becomes necessary to
make the final payment before he has submitted the required data/documents related
to the PVC:

115

“It is certified that there has been no decrease in the price of price variation indices
and, in the event of any decrease of such indices during the currency of this contract,
we shall promptly notify this to the purchaser and offer the requisite reduction in the
contract rate.”
xiii)

Notwithstanding the above formalities, it should be appreciated that it is in the
interest of the purchaser to be vigilant about downward variation and it is, therefore,
the basic responsibility of the purchase officers to make sure that the benefits of
downward variation, wherever it occurs, are fully availed of.

6.7

Exchange Rate Variation

6.7.1 In case of a contract involving substantial import content(s) and having a long
delivery period (exceeding one year from the date of contract), an appropriate Foreign
Exchange Variation clause may be formulated by the procuring entity in consultation with its
Associated/ integrated Finance, as needed, and incorporated in the tender enquiry
document. In that clause, the tenderers are to be asked to indicate import content(s) and the
currency (ies) used for calculating the value of import content(s) in their total quoted price,
which (that is, the total quoted price) will be in Indian Rupees. The tenderers may be asked
to indicate the Base Exchange rate for each such foreign currency used for converting the
foreign exchange content into Indian Rupees and the extent of foreign Exchange Rate
Variation (ERV) risk they are willing to bear.
To work out the variation due to changes (if any) in the exchange rate(s), the base date for
this purpose will be the due date of opening of tenders/seven days prior to the due date of
opening of tenders (the purchase organisation is to decide and adopt a suitable date). The
variation may be allowed between the above base date and date of remittance to the foreign
principal/mid-point of manufacture of the foreign component (the purchase organization is to
choose the appropriate date). The applicable exchange rates as above will be according to
the TT selling rates of exchange as quoted by authorised exchange bankers approved by
RBI on the dates in question. No variation in price in this regard will be allowed if the
variation in the rate of exchange remains within the limit of plus/minus ________per cent
(the purchase organisation is to decide the limit, say plus/ minus band of 2.5% (Two point
Five percent)).
Any increase or decrease in the customs duty by reason of the variation in the rate of
exchange in terms of the contract will be to the buyer's account. In case the delivery period
is revised/extended, ERV will not be admissible, if this is due to the supplier’s default;
however, ERV benefits arising out of downward trends should be passed on to Procuring
Entity. The procuring entity may formulate an appropriate ERV clause on similar lines as
above in consultation with their Finance Wing.
6.7.2 Documents for Claiming ERV
i) A bill of ERV claim enclosing the working sheet;
ii) Banker’s certificate/debit advice detailing the foreign exchange paid and exchange
rate;
iii) Copies of the import order placed on the supplier; and
iv) Supplier’s invoice for the relevant import order.

6.8

Taxes, Duties and Levies
116

6.8.1

Statutory Duties and Taxes on Domestic Goods

The duties and taxes including excise duty and VAT levied by the Government on domestic
goods vary from product to product. Unless a different intention appears from the terms of
the contract, statutory variation in duties or taxes are to be borne by the buyer (procuring
entity) as per the section 64A of the Sales of Goods Act, 1930. As a general policy, the
statutory variations in such duties and taxes are to be allowed during the period from the
date of the tender to the date of acceptance of the tender (that is, placement of the contract)
and during the original/re-fixed delivery period of the contract so that both the supplier and
purchaser are equally compensated for rise or fall in the price of the goods on account of
such statutory variations.
(Note: Re-fixed delivery period means the fresh delivery period which is arrived at by
recasting the original contractual delivery period after taking care of the lost period, for which
the supplier was not responsible.)
In the tender enquiry conditions, the tenderers, wherever applicable, should be asked to
specifically state in their offer whether they intend to ask for the duties and taxes as extra
over and above the prices being quoted. In the absence of any indication to this effect by the
tenderers, it is to be assumed that the prices quoted include these elements and no claim for
the taxes or duties or statutory variations thereon should be entertained after opening of
tenders and during the currency of the resultant contract. If a tenderer chooses to quote
price inclusive of excise duty/ Sales Tax/ VAT, it should be presumed that the duties/ taxes
so included is firm unless he has clearly indicated the rate of duties/ taxes included in his
price and also sought adjustment on account of statutory variation thereon. If a tenderer is
exempted from payment of excise duty upto a certain value of turnover, he should clearly
state that no excise duty will be charged by him upto the limit of exemption enjoyed by him. If
any concession is available in regard to rate/quantum of Central Excise Duty, it should be
brought out clearly. It should also be clearly indicated whether increase in rate of excise duty
due to increase in turn over will be borne by the tenderer. Stipulation like, “excise duty is
presently not applicable but the same will be charged if it becomes leviable later on”, should
not be accepted unless in such cases it is clearly stated by the tenderer that excise duty will
not be charged by him even if the same becomes applicable later on due to increase in
turnover. If a tenderer fails to comply with this requirement, his quoted price shall be loaded
with the quantum of maximum excise duty which is normally applicable on the item in
question for the purpose of comparison with the prices of other tenderers. The tenderers
should indicate in their offer whether they are availing VAT/ Tax credits or not. If they are
availing VAT/ Tax credits, they should take into account the entire credit on inputs available
under such Schemes while quoting the price and furnish a declaration to this effect along
with a confirmation that any further benefit available in future on account of such schemes
would be passed on to the purchaser.
Note: Sales tax/ VAT are not levied on transactions of sale in the course of import.
Categories of cases constituting sale in course of import are:
Where the movement of goods from the foreign country to India is occasioned
directly as a result of the sale;
ii) Where the Indian supplier acts as the agent of the foreign manufacturer in the
agreement of the sale.
6.8.2 Octroi and Local Taxes
i)

117

In case the goods supplied against contracts placed by Procuring Entity are exempted from
levy of town duty, Octroi duty, terminal tax and other levies of local bodies, the suppliers
should be informed accordingly by incorporating suitable instructions in the tender enquiry
document and in the resultant contract. Wherever required, the supplier should obtain the
exemption certificate from the Purchasing Department to avoid payment of such levies and
taxes.
In case such payments are not exempted (or are demanded in spite of the exemption
certificate), the supplier should make the payment to avoid delay in supplies and forward the
receipt to the Purchasing Department for reimbursement and for further necessary action.
6.8.3 Customs Duty on Imported Goods
On imported goods, the tenderers shall also specify separately the total amount of custom
duty included in the quoted price. The tenderers should also indicate correctly the rate of
custom duty applicable for the goods in question and the corresponding Indian customs tariff
number. Where customs duty is payable, the contract should clearly stipulate the quantum of
duty payable, and so on, in unambiguous terms. The standard clauses to be utilised for this
purpose are to be incorporated in the tender enquiry documents. Any import of materials
directly from the supplier or manufacturer should be in the name of Procuring Entity. In this
regard, all formalities will be completed by Procuring Entity engaging a Custom House Agent
(CHA) and payment in this regard will be borne by Procuring Entity.
The Government has allowed exemption from payment of customs duty on certain types of
goods for use by the following organisations:

i)
ii)
iii)

Scientific and technical instruments imported by research institutes;
Hospital equipment imported by Government hospitals; and
Consumable goods imported by a public-funded research institution or a university.
However, to avail of such exemptions, the organisations are required to produce a "Custom
Duty Exemption" certificate and "Not Manufactured in India" certificate at the appropriate
time.
The relevant contemporary instructions covering these aspects should be incorporated in the
tender enquiry document and in the resultant contract.
6.8.4 Duties/Taxes on Raw Materials
Procuring Entity is not liable for any claim from the supplier on account of fresh imposition
and/or increase (including statutory increase) in excise duty, custom duty, sales tax, and so
on, on raw materials and/or components used directly in the manufacture of the contracted
goods taking place during the pendency of the contract, unless such liability is specifically
agreed to in terms of the contract. A clause to this effect should also form part of the tender
documents

Incoterms rules mainly describe the tasks, costs and risks involved in the delivery of goods
from the seller to the buyer. The risk to goods
(damage, loss, shortage, and so on) is
the responsibility of the person who holds the ‘title of goods’ at that point of time. This may
be different from actual physical possession of such goods. Normally, unless otherwise
defined, the title of goods passes from the supplier to the purchaser in accordance with the
terms of delivery (FOR, CFR, among others). The terms of delivery, therefore, specify when
the ownership and title of goods pass from the seller to buyer, along with the associated
risks. Incoterms as described by the International Chamber of Commerce are an
internationally accepted interpretation of the terms of delivery. These terms of delivery
allocate responsibilities to the buyer and seller, with respect to:
i) Control and care of the goods while in transit;
ii) Carrier selection, transfers and related issues;
iii) Costs of freight, insurance, taxes, duties and forwarding fees; and
iv) Documentation, problem resolution and other related issues.
In use since 1936, Incoterms have been revised in 2010. Out of the 11 Incoterms options,
seven apply to all modes of transportation whereas four apply only to water transportation.

The options range from one extreme – the buyer takes full responsibility from point of
departure – to the other extreme: the seller is responsible all the way through delivery to the
buyer's location. It is easiest to understand terms as per their nomenclature groupings: ‘ex’
group of terms where the buyer takes full responsibility from point of departure; ‘free’ group
of terms in which the freight is not paid by the seller; ‘C’ group of terms in which the freight is
paid by the seller; and ‘delivered’ group of terms where the seller takes full responsibility
from an intermediate point to an arrival point (Annexure 16).
Within national transportation, certain terms have assumed acceptance due to usage. FOR
has two versions: FOR/dispatching and FOR/destination (the buyer is responsible from the
nominated point mentioned till arrival point, as in Delivery at Terminal). Infrequently, it is also
used in road transport as FOT.

6.10

e-Payment

e -Banking and e-payments are now used by various banks by adopting Electronic Clearing
System (ECS) and Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT/ RTGS) procedure. Payments to
suppliers may be made through such mechanism where such facilities are available. As per
RBI guidelines, ECS mandate in RBI’s format may be obtained at the time of registration of
suppliers and in the bid document. The Format is available with all Banks.

119

6.11 Deduction of Income Tax, Service Tax, and so on, at Source from
Payments to Suppliers
This will be done as per the existing law in force during the currency of the contract.

6.12

Recovery of Public Money from Supplier's Bill

Sometimes, requests are received from a different ministry/Department for withholding some
payment of a supplier out of the payment due to it against a contract. Such requests are to
be examined by the ministry/Department (which has received the request) on the merits of
the case for further action. It will, however, be the responsibility of the ministry/Department
asking for withholding of payment to defend the Government against any legal procedure
arising out of such withholding as also for payment of any interest thereof.

6.13

Refund from Supplier

Sometimes, the supplier, after claiming and receiving reimbursements for sales tax, excise
duty, custom duty, and so on, from the purchaser, applies to the concerned authorities for
refunds, on genuine grounds, of certain portions of such duties and taxes paid by it and
receives the allowable refunds. Such refunds contain the purchaser's share also (out of the
payments already made by the purchaser to that supplier). The tender enquiry document
and the contract are to contain suitable provisions for obtaining such refunds from the
supplier.

6.14

Payment against Time Barred Claims

Ordinarily, all claims against the Government are time barred after a period of three years
calculated from the date when the payment falls due unless the payment claim has been
under correspondence. However, the limitation is saved if there is an admission of liability to
pay, and fresh period of limitation starts from the time such admission is made. The drill to
be followed while dealing with time barred claims will be decided by the ministry/Department
concerned in consultation with the paying authority. The paying authority is to ensure that no
payment against such time barred claim is made till a decision has been taken in this regard
by the CA.

120

Chapter 7: Evaluation of Bids and Award of Contract
7.1

Tender Evaluation

7.1.1 The evaluation of tenders is one of the most significant areas of purchase
management and the process must be transparent. All tenders are to be evaluated strictly on
the basis of the terms and conditions incorporated in the tender document and those
stipulated by the tenderers in their tenders. The Contracting Authority may include quality,
price, technical merit, aesthetic and functional characteristics, environmental characteristics,
running costs, cost- effectiveness, after-sales service and technical assistance, delivery date
and delivery period or period of completion etc. No criteria shall be used for evaluation of
tenders that cannot be verified. No hearsay information or hitherto undeclared condition
should be brought in while evaluating the tenders. Care should be taken that preferences
provided to any category of bidders on certain specified grounds should not result in single
vendor selection. Similarly, no tender enquiry condition (especially the significant/essential
ones) should be overlooked/ relaxed while evaluating the tenders. The aim should be ensure
that no tenderer gets undue advantage at the cost of other tenderers and/or at the cost of
Procuring Entity. Information relating to evaluation of tenders and the Tender Committee’s
(TC’s) deliberations should be confidential and not be shared with persons not officially
connected with the process. TC should normally comprise of three members including
Financial Adviser or his representative and a representative of the user as per SoPP in order
to carry out evaluation of the tenders. TC should not be very large as it may slow down the
evaluation process. However, suitable domain/ technical experts may be included in the
committee to render assistance in evaluation of the bids. There is no need to constitute any
other committee for technical evaluation, preliminary evaluation, etc. The representative of
the user Department will work as a convenor of the TC. As per Rule 173 (xxii) of GFR 2017
no member of the tender committee should be reporting directly to any other member of
such committee in case estimated value of the procurement exceeds Rs. 25 lakh. Though
the GFR stipulates this provision only when the estimated value of procurement exceeds Rs
25 lakh, it is desirable that the same provision should be followed in the constitution of all
purchase committees irrespective of the value of procurement. The process of tender
evaluation proceeds is described in the subsequent paras.
7.1.2

Schedule of Procurement Powers (SoPP)

There are delegations upto a threshold value below which the evaluation of the Bids may be
entrusted solely and directly by individual competent authority, without involvement of a
Tender committee or any evaluation report. He would himself carry out all the steps in
evaluation described below, instead of the TC and directly records reasons and decision on
the file itself. He may ask for a Technical Suitability report from User Departments, if so
needed. In procurements above such a threshold, evaluation is by Tender Committee
consisting of three or more officers, however no member of the Committee should be
reporting directly to any other member of such Committee. Procuring Entity should lay down
a Schedule of Procurement Powers (SoPP) detail such thresholds. It can also lay down the
powers jurisdiction and composition of different levels of Tender Committee and
corresponding Accepting Authority for different categories of procurement and different
threshold values of procurements. A suggested format for SoPP is at Annexure 2B/2C,

121

however exact values of threshold would have to be decided by Procuring Entity themselves.
Competent authority, in direct acceptance case; and member secretary of the Tender
Committee will receive the bids opened along with other documents from the tender opening
officials and are responsible for safe-custody of the documents and for processing involved
at all steps in finalising the Procurement.

7.2

Preparation and Vetting of Comparative Statement

Except in cases upto Rs 25 Lakh (Rupees Twenty Five Lakh) the Procuring Entity should
prepare a comparative statement of quotations received in the order in which tenders were
opened. In case of Techno-Commercial bid comparative statement will have information
about deciding responsiveness and eligibility of bids and evaluation of Technical suitability of
offers. In case of Financial bid it would have information about rates quoted (including taxes
or otherwise), discount, if any, and any other information having implications on ranking of
bids etc. The comparative statement so prepared should be signed by the concerned
officers. It may also be vetted by the associated/ integrated Finance for veracity of
information.

7.3

Preliminary Examination

7.3.1 Unresponsive Tenders
Tenders that do not meet the basic requirements specified in the bid documents are to be
treated as unresponsive and ignored. All tenders received will first be scrutinised by the TC
to see whether the tenders meet the basic requirements as incorporated in the Bid document
and to identify unresponsive tenders, if any. Some important points on the basis of which a
tender may be declared as unresponsive and be ignored during the initial scrutiny are:
i)

The tender is not in the prescribed format or is unsigned or not signed as per the
stipulations in the bid document;

ii)

The required EMD has not been provided or exemption from EMD is claimed without
acceptable proof of exemption;

iii)

The bidder is not eligible to participate in the bid as per laid down eligibility
criteria(example: the tender enquiry condition says that the bidder has to be a
registered MSE unit but the tenderer is a, say, a large scale unit);

iv)

The tenderer has quoted for goods manufactured by a different firm without the
required authority letter from the proposed manufacturer;

v)

The bid departs from the essential requirements specified in the bidding document
(for example, the tenderer has not agreed to give the required performance security);
or

vi)

Against a schedule in the list of requirements in the tender enquiry, the tenderer has
not quoted for the entire requirement as specified in that schedule (example: in a
schedule, it has been stipulated that the tenderer will supply the equipment, install
and commission it and also train the purchaser's operators for operating the
equipment. The tenderer has, however, quoted only for supply of the equipment).

7.3.2 Non-conformities between Figures and Words
Sometimes, non-conformities/errors are also observed in responsive tenders between the
quoted prices in figures and in words. This situation normally does not arise in case of eProcurement. This should be taken care of in the manner indicated below:

122

i)

If, in the price structure quoted for the required goods, there is discrepancy between
the unit price and total price (which is obtained by multiplying the unit price by the
quantity), the unit price shall prevail and the total price corrected accordingly;

ii)

If there is an error in a total corresponding to the addition or subtraction of sub-totals,
the sub-totals shall prevail and the total shall be corrected; and

iii)

If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall
prevail.

iv)

Such a discrepancy in an offer should be conveyed to the tenderer asking him to
respond by a target date and if the tenderer does not agree to Procuring Entity’s
observation, the tender is liable to be rejected.

7.3.3 Discrepancies between Original and Additional/ Scanned Copies of a Tender
Discrepancies can also be observed in responsive tenders between the original copy and
other copies of the same tender set. In such a case, the text, and so on, of the original copy
will prevail. Here also, this issue is to be taken up with the tenderer in the same manner as
above and subsequent actions taken accordingly. In e-Procurement there could be
discrepancies between the uploaded scanned copies and the Originals submitted by the
bidder. However normally no submission of original documents in physical format (other than
Cost of Bid Documents (if any, refer Para 5.2.1Cost and Availability of Tender Documents),
Bid Security and statutory certificates if any) should be asked for in e-Procurement
7.3.4 Minor Infirmity/Irregularity/Non-conformity
During the preliminary examination, some minor infirmity and/or irregularity and/or nonconformity may also be found in some tenders. Such minor issues could be a missing pages/
attachment or illegibility in a submitted document; non-submission of requisite number of
copies of a document. There have been also cases where the bidder submitted the
amendment Bank Guarantee, but omitted to submit the main portion of Bid Document. The
court ruled that this is a minor irregularity. Such minor issues may be waived provided they
do not constitute any material deviation (please refer to Para 7.4.1 (d)) and financial impact
and, also, do not prejudice or affect the ranking order of the tenderers. Wherever necessary,
observations on such ‘minor’ issues (as mentioned above) may be conveyed to the tenderer
by registered letter/speed post, and so on, asking him to respond by a specified date also
mentioning therein that, if the tenderer does not conform Procuring Entity’s view or respond
by that specified date, his tender will be liable to be rejected. Depending on the outcome,
such tenders are to be ignored or considered further.
7.3.5 Clarification of Bids/Shortfall Documents
During evaluation and comparison of bids, the purchaser may, at his discretion, ask the
bidder for clarifications on the bid. The request for clarification shall be given in writing by
registered/speed post, asking the tenderer to respond by a specified date, and also
mentioning therein that, if the tenderer does not comply or respond by the date, his tender
will be liable to be rejected. Depending on the outcome, such tenders are to be ignored or
considered further. No change in prices or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered or
permitted. No post-bid clarification at the initiative of the bidder shall be entertained. The
shortfall information/documents should be sought only in case of historical documents which
pre-existed at the time of the tender opening and which have not undergone change since
then. These should be called only on basis of the recommendations of the TC. (Example: if
the Permanent Account Number, registration with sales tax/ VAT has been asked to be

123

submitted and the tenderer has not provided them, these documents may be asked for with
a target date as above). So far as the submission of documents is concerned with regard to
qualification criteria, after submission of the tender, only related shortfall documents should
be asked for and considered. For example, if the bidder has submitted a supply order
without its completion/performance certificate, the certificate can be asked for and
considered. However, no new supply order should be asked for so as to qualify the bidder.

7.4 Evaluation of Responsive Bids and Decision on Award of Contract
All responsive bids are evaluated by the TC with a view to select the lowest (L1) bidder who
meets the qualification criteria and techno-commercial aspects. In case of single stage single
envelop bidding, the evaluation of qualification of bidders, technical, commercial and
financial aspect is done simultaneously. In single stage multiple envelops, initially only the
techno-commercial bids would be opened and evaluated for bids which successfully meet
the qualification criteria and techno-commercial aspects. Financial bids of such successful
bidders only would be opened for selecting the L1 bidder among these and in case of
manual tenders, financial bids of unsuccessful bidders would be returned unopened to them.
In two stage bids, the PQB/ EoI stage would have already been evaluated as detailed in
Chapter 4 and this second stage is for evaluation of responses to the Second Stage multiple
envelops from the shortlisted qualified bidders. Evaluation of techno-commercial and
financial aspects are, however, discussed separately below. It is of utmost importance that
the authenticity, integrity and sanctity of unopened Financial Bids must be ensured, before
their opening. All the financial bids may preferably be put in a large envelop, which may be
dated, sealed and signed (including by some of the bidders present), to show that none of
the bids were accessed during the custody.
7.4.1 Evaluation of Techno-commercial Bid
In evaluation of the techno-commercial bid, conformity of the eligibility/qualification, technical
and commercial conditions of the offered goods to those in the bid document is ascertained.
Additional factors, if any, incorporated in the tender documents may also be considered in
the manner indicated therein. Evaluation has to be based only on the conditions included in
the tender document and any other condition should not form the basis of this evaluation.

i) Evaluation of eligibility/ qualification Criteria: Procuring Entity will determine,
to its satisfaction, whether the tenderers are eligible, qualified and capable in all
respects to perform the contract satisfactorily. Tenders that do not meet the
required eligibility/qualification criteria prescribed will be treated as unresponsive
and not considered further. This determination will, inter-alia, take into account
the tenderer’s financial, technical and production capabilities for satisfying all of
Procuring Entity’s requirements as incorporated in the tender document. Such
determination will be based upon scrutiny and examination of all relevant data
and details submitted by the tenderer in its/his tender as well as such other allied
information as deemed appropriate by Procuring Entity.

ii)

Evaluation of Technical Suitability: The description, specifications, drawings and
other technical terms and conditions are examined by TC in general and a technical
member of the TC in particular. Nobody outside the TC should be allowed to
determine this evaluation. The tender document should clearly state whether
alternative offers/makes/models would be considered or not and, in the absence of
an express statement to the effect, these should not be allowed. An important

124

document is the exceptions/deviation form submitted by the tenderer. It is important
to judge whether an exception/deviation is minor or major. Minor
exceptions/deviations may be waived provided they do not constitute any material
deviation and do not have significant financial impact and, also, would not prejudice
or affect the ranking order of the price bid. Exceptions/deviations should not grant the
tenderer any undue advantage vis-à-vis other tenders and Procuring Entity.

iii)

Evaluation of Commercial Conditions: The TC will also evaluate the commercial
conditions quoted by the tenderer to confirm that all terms and conditions specified in
the GCC/SCC have been accepted without reservations by the tenderer. Only minor
deviations may be accepted/allowed, provided these do not constitute material
deviations without financial impact and do not grant the tenderer any undue
advantage vis-à-vis other tenders and Procuring Entity.

iv)

Considering Minor Deviations: Court has consistently taken a view that procuring
entity is entitled to consider and allow minor deviations, which do not amount to
material deviations. A material deviation, reservation, or omission which should not
be waived are those that:
a) Affects, in any substantial way, the scope, quality or performance of the goods
and related services specified in the contract;
b) Limits, in any substantial way, inconsistent with the tendering documents, the
procuring entity's rights or the tenderer's obligations under the contract; or
c) If rectified, would unfairly affect the competitive position of other tenderers
quoting substantially responsive tenders.

v)

Declaration of Successful Bidders: If it is a multiple envelop tender, then the TC
prepares a recommendation of techno-commercial bid (Annexure 11) to declare
successful bidders. In such cases, after the approval of CA, the results of the
Techno-commercial bid evaluation are to be announced (including informing the
failed Bidders). Price bids are opened in the presence of technically suitable bidders,
who are willing to attend the bid opening, at a pre-publicised date, time and place or
on the portal in case of e-procurement. In single envelop/cover tender, TC proceeds
to evaluate the price aspects without a reference to CA at this stage.

7.4.2 Right of Bidder to question rejection at Techno-commercial Stage
A tenderer shall have the right to be heard in case he feels that a proper procurement
process is not being followed and/or his Techno-commercial bid has been rejected wrongly.
The tenderer is to be permitted to send his representation in writing. On receipt of
representation it may be decided whether to withhold opening of the financial bids and
bidder may be expeditiously replied. Certain decisions of the procuring entity in accordance
with the provision of internal guidelines shall not be subject to review as mentioned in para
7.6.3 below.
7.4.3

Evaluation of Financial Bids and Ranking of Tenders In general:
i) If the price bid is ambiguous so that it may very well lead to two equally valid total
price amounts, then the bid should be treated as unresponsive;
ii) Sometime certain bidders offer suo motu discounts and rebates after opening of
the tender (techno-commercial or financial). Such rebates/discounts should not
be considered for the purpose of ranking the offer but if such a firm does become

125

L1 at its original offer, such suo motu rebates can be incorporated in the
contracts. This also applies to conditional rebates, for example, rebate for faster
payments, and so on;
iii) Unless announced beforehand explicitly in the tender documents, the quoted
price should not be loaded on the basis of deviations in the commercial
conditions. If it is decided to incorporate such clauses, these should be
unambiguous and clear – and thereafter there should be no relaxation during
evaluation. Moreover, sometimes, while purchasing sophisticated and costly
equipment, machinery, and so on, the procuring entity also gives special
importance to factors such as high quality performance, environmental-friendly
features, low running cost, low maintenance cost, and so on. To take care of this,
relevant details are to be incorporated in the bid document and the criteria
adopted to assess the benefit of such features while evaluating the offers are
also to be clearly stipulated in the tender enquiry document so that the tenderers
are aware of it and quote accordingly. While evaluating such offers, these
aspects are also to be taken into account. Such details, whenever considered
necessary, should be evolved by the competent technical authority for
incorporation in the tender document, so that there is no ambiguity and/or
vagueness in them;
iv) Normally, the comparison of the responsive tenders shall be on total outgo from
the Procuring Entity’s pocket, for the procurement to be paid to the supplier or
any third party, including all elements of costs as per the terms of the proposed
contract, including any taxes, duties, levies etc, freight insurance etc. Therefore it
should normally be on the basis of CIF/ FOR destination basis, duly delivered,
commissioned, as the case may be:
v) In the case of goods manufactured in India or goods of foreign origin already
located in India, VAT/sales tax and excise duty and other similar taxes and
duties, which will be contractually payable (to the tenderer) on the goods are to
be added;
vi) In the case of goods of foreign origin offered from abroad, customs duty and
other similar import duties/taxes, which will be contractually payable (to the
tenderer) on the goods, are to be added;
vii) As per policies of the Government from time to time, the purchaser reserves his
option to give price/ purchase preferences as indicated in the tender document;
viii) In case the list of requirements contains more than one schedule, the responsive,
technically suitable tenders will be evaluated and compared separately for each
schedule. The tender for a schedule will not be considered if the complete
requirements prescribed in that schedule are not included in the tender. However,
tenderers have the option to quote for any one or more schedules and offer
discounts for combined schedules. Such discounts, wherever applicable, will be
taken into account to for deciding the lowest evaluated cost for Procuring Entity in
deciding the successful tenderer for each schedule, subject to that tenderer(s)
being responsive; and

126

ix) If the tenders have been invited on a variable price basis, the tenders will be
evaluated, compared and ranked on the basis of the position prevailing on the
day of tender (Technical Bid) opening and not on the basis of any future date.
GTE Tenders
Special aspects of evaluation of the financial offer in GTE tenders are:
i)

Currency of Tender
In GTE tenders, the price in the quotation could be in US Dollar or Euro or Pound
Sterling or Yen or in currencies under the RBI’s notified basket of currencies, in
addition to the Indian Rupees, except for expenditure incurred in India (including
agency commission if any) which should be stated in Indian Rupees. All offers are to
be converted to Indian Rupees based on the “Bill currency selling” exchange rate on
the date of tender opening (Techno-commercial offer) from a source as specified in
the tender document.
ii) Currency of Payment
The contract price will be normally paid in the currency/currencies in which the price
is stated in the contract.
iii) Evaluation of Offers
As per Government policy, Ministries/Departments/Public Sector Undertakings
(PSUs) should ensure imports on FOB/FAS basis failing which a No Objection
Certificate (NOC) should be obtained from the Ministry of Surface Transport
(Chartering Wing).
The foreign bidders are normally asked, in the bid documents, to quote both on FAS/FOB
basis and also on Cost and Freight (CFR)/CIF basis duly indicating the break-up of prices for
freight, insurance, and so on, with purchasers reserving the right to order on either basis.
They should also to indicate the custom tariff number and custom duty applicable in India. In
the case of FAS/FOB offers, the freight and insurance shall be (after ascertaining, if not
quoted) added to make up the CIF cost. To arrive at the Free On Rail (FOR) cost, one per
cent shall be added over and above CIF as port handling charges, custom duty,
countervailing duty and surcharges, as applicable on the date of opening of the tender, as
well as clearing agency charges, inland freight and Octroi/ entry tax, as assessed, may be
added to make it a FOR/Free On Truck (FOT) destination. The FOR/FOT destination price
for domestic offers may be calculated as in OTE tenders. For bids with Letter of Credit (LC)
payment, the likely LC charges (as ascertained from Procuring Entity’s bankers) should also
be loaded.
In case both Indian and foreign bidders have quoted in the tender, the comparison of the
offers would be done on the basis of FOR/FOT destination including all applicable taxes and
duties (on the principle of the total outgo from Procuring Entity’s pockets). In case there are
no domestic bidders, a comparison of offers can be made on the basis of CIF/landed costs
since the rest of costs would be same for all bidders.

7.5

Deliberations by the Tender Committee for Award of Contract.

7.5.1 Timely Processing of Tenders (Rule 174 (i) of GFR 2017)
Delays in finalising procurement deprive the public of the intended benefits and results in lost
revenues and cost over-run. To enable timely decision making, complete Time schedule of
finalising the Tender process from the date of issuing the tender to date of issuing the
contract, should be published in the Bid Documents. Every official in the chain of the

127

procurement operation is accountable for taking action in a specified time so that the tender
is finalised on time. Any deviation from the schedule may be monitored and explained, by
way of system of Management Reporting (Appendix 4 and 5). As a check, the proposed
schedule of tender process may be printed on the inside cover of the Procurement File,
where actual date of completion of various stages may be recorded. The suggestive time
schedule in Table 2 is a guideline for finalising contracts against various modes of
procurements.

This time schedule is only indicative and the schedule shall be subject to change based on
the nature of requirements, sourcing, sample evaluation, site visit/pre-bid meeting with
prospective bidders and Government, guidelines, and so on.
7.5.2 Extension of Tender Validity Period
The entire process of scrutiny and evaluation of tenders, preparation of ranking statement
and notification of award must be done expeditiously and within the original tender validity
period (Rule 174 (iii) of GFR 2017). The validity period should not be unreasonably long as
keeping the tender unconditionally valid for acceptance for a longer period entails the risk of
getting higher prices from the tenderers.
If, however, due to some exceptional and unforeseen reasons, the purchase organisation is
unable to decide on the placement of the contract within the original validity period, it may
preferably request, before expiry of the original validity period, all the responsive tenderers to
extend their tenders up to a specified period. While asking for such extension, the tenderers
are also to be asked to extend their offers as it is, without any changes therein. They may
also be told to extend the validity of the EMD for the corresponding additional period (which
is to be specified in the request). A tenderer may not agree to such a request and this will
not be tantamount to forfeiture of its EMD. But the tenderers, who agree to extend the
validity, are to do so without changing any terms, conditions, and so on, of their original
tenders.
7.5.3 Variation of Quantities at the Time of Award
At the time of awarding the contract, the quantity to be procured must be re-judged based on
the current data, since the ground situation may have very well changed. The tendered
quantity can be increased or decreased by 25 (twenty-five) per cent for ordering, if so
warranted. This may be mentioned in the tender documents. Any larger variation may throw
up issues about transparency.
7.5.4

Option clause

128

In case of long running, yearly procurements, to take care of any change in the requirement
during the currency of the contract, a plus/minus option clause[normally 25 (twenty-five) per
cent] is incorporated in the tender document, reserving purchaser's right to increase or
decrease the quantity of the required goods up to that limit without any change in the terms
and conditions and prices quoted by the tenderers. Higher the option limit more is the
uncertainty for the tenderers in formulating their prices and more is the chance of loading on
the prices quoted to take care of such uncertainties.
7.5.5 Splitting of Contracts/ Parallel Contracts
After due processing, if it is discovered that the quantity to be ordered is far more than
whatL1aloneiscapableofsupplyingand there was no prior decision/ declaration in the bidding
documents to split the quantities, then the quantity being finally ordered may be distributed
among the other bidders by counter offering the L1 rate in a manner that is fair, transparent
and equitable based on objective data available in the bids e.g. eligibility data, Quantity/
Delivery etc.
However, in case of critical/ vital/ safety/ security nature of the item, large quantity under
procurement, urgent delivery requirements and inadequate vendor capacity it may be
advantageous to decide in advance to have more than one source of supply. In such cases
a parallel contract clause should be added to the bid documents, clearly stating that
Procuring Entity reserves the right to split the contract quantity between suppliers. The
manner of deciding the relative share of lowest bidder (L1) contractor and the rest of the
contractors/tenderers should be clearly defined, along with the minimum number of suppliers
sought for the contract. In case of splitting in two and three, the ratio of 70:30; 50:30:20,
respectively, may be used – a different ratio may also be justified.
Before splitting the quantity, it should be ensured that the L1 price is reasonable. If it is not
reasonable, negotiation with the L1 party may be carried out, if justifiable, with the approval
of the CA. The following guidelines are to be considered while opting for parallel contracts:

i) L1 should be awarded at least the percentage mentioned above or his spare supply
capacity, whichever is lower; and

ii) For the rest of the contract quantity, the lowest rate accepted will be counter offered
to the L2 party. On acceptance of the counter offer, the order will be placed on L2 for
the respective percentage or the spare supply capacity of the L2 bidder, whichever is
lower, and so on, to other tenderers. In case of non-acceptance of the counter offer
by the L2 party, a similar offer shall be made to L3 and L4, and so on.
7.5.6 Reasonableness of Prices
In every recommendation of the TC for award of contract, it must be declared that the rates
recommended are reasonable.
[For more details on judging reasonableness of prices, please see para 2.1.1 (iii)(e) in
Chapter 2 above].
Where there is no estimated cost, a comparison with Last Purchase Price (LPP - the price
paid in the latest successful contract) is the basis for judging reasonableness of rates. The
following points may be kept in mind before LPP is relied upon as a basis for justifying rate
reasonableness:

129

i) The basic price, taxes, duties, transportation charges, Packing and Forwarding
charges should be indicated separately;
ii) Where the firm holding the LPP contract has defaulted, the fact should be highlighted
and the price paid against the latest contract placed prior to the defaulting LPP
contract, where supplies have been completed, should be used;
iii) Where the supply against the LPP contract is yet to commence, that is, delivery is not
yet due, it should be taken as LPP with caution, especially if the supplier is new, the
price paid against the previous contract may also be kept in view;
iv) Where the price indicated in the LPP is subject to variation or if it is more than a year
old, the updated price or as computed in case of the Price Variation Clause (PVC)
may also be indicated;
v) In the case of wholly imported stores, the comparison of the last purchase rate
should be made with the net CIF value at the current foreign exchange rate;
vi) It is natural to have marginal differences in prices obtained at different cities/offices
for the same item, due to their different circumstances. The prices obtained are
greatly influenced by quantity, delivery period, terms of the contract, these may be
kept in view; and
vii) Prices paid in emergencies or prices offered in a distress sale are not accurate
guidelines for future use. Such purchase orders and TC proceedings should indicate
that “these prices are not valid LPP for comparison in future procurement”.
7.5.7 Consideration of Abnormally Low Bids
An Abnormally Low Bid is one in which the Bid price, in combination with other elements of
the Bid, appears so low that it raises material concerns as to the capability of the Bidder to
perform the contract at the offered price. Procuring Entity may in such cases seek written
clarifications from the Bidder, including detailed price analyses of its Bid price in relation to
scope, schedule, allocation of risks and responsibilities, and any other requirements of the
bids document. If, after evaluating the price analyses, procuring entity determines that the
Bidder has substantially failed to demonstrate its capability to deliver the contract at the
offered price, the Procuring Entity may reject the Bid/Proposal. However it would not be
advisable to fix a normative percentage below the estimated cost, which would be
automatically be considered as an abnormally low bid. Due care should be taken while
formulating the specifications at the time of preparation of bid document so as to have a
safeguard against the submission of abnormally low bid from the bidder.
In the case of predatory pricing as well, procuring entities may refer to the above
consideration of Abnormally Low Bids to assist themselves in finalization of tenders75.
No provisions should be kept in the Bid Documents regarding the Additional Security
Deposit/ Bank Guarantee (BG) in case of Abnormally Low Bids. Wherever, there are
compelling circumstances to ask for Additional Security Deposit/ Bank Guarantee (BG) in
case of ALBs, the same should be taken only with the approval of the next higher authority

75

In reference to OM No.F.12/17/2019-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 06.02.2020

130

competent to finalise the particular tender, or the Secretary of the Ministry/ Department,
whichever is lower76.
7.5.8 Cartel Formation/Pool Rates
It is possible that sometimes a group of bidders quote the same rate against a tender. Such
pool/cartel formation is against the basic principle of competitive bidding and defeats the
very purpose of an open and competitive tendering system. Such and similar tactics to
avoid/control true competition in a tender leading to "Appreciable Adverse Effect on
Competition" (AAEC) have been declared as an offence under the Competition Act, 2002, as
amended by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007. Such practices should be severely
discouraged with strong measures. In case of evidence of cartel formation, detailed cost
analysis may be done by associating experts if necessary. Besides, suitable administrative
actions can be resorted to, such as rejecting the offers, reporting the matter to trade
associations, the Competition Commission or NSIC, etc., and requesting them, inter-alia, to
take suitable strong actions against such firms. New firms may also be encouraged to get
themselves registered for the subject goods to break the monopolistic attitude of the firms
forming a cartel. Changes in the mode of procurement (GTE instead of OTE) and
packaging/slicing of the tendered quantity and items may also be tried. A warning clause
may also be included in the bid documents to discourage the bidders from indulging in such
practices.
7.5.9

Negotiations (Rule 173 (xiv) of GFR 2017)

i) Normally, there should be no negotiation. Negotiations should be a rare exception
rather than the rule and may be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances. If it is
decided to hold negotiations for reduction of prices, they should be held only with the
lowest acceptable bidder (L1), who is techno-commercially responsive for the supply
of a bulk quantity and on whom the contract would have been placed but for the
decision to negotiate. In no case, including where a cartel/pool rates are suspected,
should negotiations be extended to those who had either not tendered originally or
whose tender was rejected because of unresponsiveness of bid, unsatisfactory
credentials, inadequacy of capacity or unworkable rates. The circumstances where
negotiations may be considered could be:
a) Where the procurement is done on nomination basis;
b) Procurement is from single or limited sources;
c) Procurements where there is suspicion of cartel formation which should be
recorded; and
d) Where the requirements are urgent and the delay in re-tendering for the entire
requirement due to the unreasonableness of the quoted rates would jeopardise
essential operations, maintenance and safety, negotiations with L1 bidder(s) may
be done for bare minimum quantum of requirements. The balance bulk
requirement should, however, be procured through a re-tender, following the
normal tendering process.

76

Notified vide OM No. F.9/4/2020-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 12.11.2020

131

ii) The decision whether to invite fresh tenders or to negotiate and with whom, should
be made by the tender accepting authority based on the recommendations of the TC.
Convincing reasons must be recorded by the authority recommending negotiations.
The CA should exercise due diligence while accepting a tender or ordering
negotiations or calling for a re-tender and a definite timeframe should be indicated.

iii) Normally all counter offers are considered negotiations by other means and the
principles of negotiations should apply to such counter offers. For example, a counter
offer to L1, in order to arrive at an acceptable rate, shall amount to a negotiation.
However, any counter offer to L2, L3, and so on (at the rates accepted by L1) in case
of splitting of quantities shall not be deemed to be a negotiation.

iv) After the CA has decided to call a specific bidder for negotiation, the following
procedure should be adopted:
a) It must be understood that, if the period of validity of the original offer expires
before the close of negotiations, the original offer will not be available for
acceptance. The period of validity of the original offer must, therefore, be
extended, wherever necessary, before negotiations;
b) The tenderer to be called in for negotiations should be addressed as per the
format of letter laid down in Annexure 12, so that the rates originally quoted by
him shall remain open for acceptance in the event of failure of the contemplated
negotiation;
c) A negotiations meeting should be started only after obtaining a signed declaration
from the negotiating supplier as per Annexure 12; and
d) Revised bids should be obtained in writing from the selected tenderers at the end
of the negotiations in the format of letter laid down in Annexure 13. The revised
bids so obtained should be read out to the tenderers or their representatives
present, immediately after completing the negotiations. If necessary, the
negotiating party may be given some time to submit its revised offer. In case,
however, the selected bidder prefers to send a revised bid instead of being
present at the negotiation, the offer should be taken into account. In case a
bidder does not submit the revised bid, its original bid shall be considered.
7.5.10 Consideration of Lack of Competition in OTE/ GTE and LTE [Rule 173 (xix) and
(xxi) of GFR 2017]
Sometimes, against advertised/limited tender cases, the procuring entity may not receive a
sufficient number of bids and/or after analysing the bids, ends up with only one responsive
bid – a situation referred to as ‘Single Offer’. As per Rule 21 of DFPR (explanation subpara), such situation of ‘Single Offer’ is to be treated as Single Tender. It has become a
practice among some procuring entities to routinely assume that open tenders which result
in single bids are not acceptable, and to go for re-tender as a ‘safe’ course of action. This is
not correct. Re-bidding has costs: firstly the actual costs of retendering; secondly the delay
in execution of the work with consequent delay in the attainment of the purpose for which the
procurement is being done; and thirdly the possibility that the re-bid may result in a higher

132

bid77. Even when only one Bid is submitted, the process may be considered valid provided
following conditions are satisfied:

i) The procurement was satisfactorily advertised and sufficient time was given for
submission of bids.

ii) The qualification criteria were not unduly restrictive; and
iii) Prices are reasonable in comparison to market values
However restricted powers of Single tender mode of procurement would apply. In case of
price not being reasonable, negotiations (being L1) or retender may be considered as
justifiable.
Unsolicited offers against LTEs should be ignored, however Ministries/Departments should
evolve a system by which interested firms can register and bid in next round of tendering.
However, under the following exceptional circumstances, these may be considered for
acceptance at the next higher level of competency:
a)
Inadequate Competition
b)
Non-availability of suitable quotations from registered vendors
c)
Urgent demand and capacity/capability of the firm offering the
unsolicited being known, etc.
7.5.11 Cancellation of Procurement Process/ Rejection of All Bids/Re-tender [Rule 173
(xix) of GFR 2017]
i) The Procuring Entity may cancel the process of procurement or rejecting all bids at
any time before intimating acceptance of successful bid under circumstances
mentioned below. In case where responsive bids are available, the aim should be to
finalise the tender by taking mitigating measures even in the conditions described
below. If it is decided to rebid the tender, the justification should balance the
perceived risks in finalisation of tender (marginally higher rates) against the certainty
of resultant delays, cost escalations, loss of transparency in re-invited tender. After
such decision, all participating bidders would be informed and bids if not opened
would not be opened and in case of manual tenders be returned unopened:
a) If the quantity and quality of requirements have changed substantially or
there is an un-rectifiable infirmity in the bidding process;
b) when none of the tenders is substantially responsive to the requirements of
the Procurement Documents;
c) none of the technical Proposals meets the minimum technical qualifying
score;
d) If effective competition is lacking. However lack of competition shall not be
determined solely on the basis of the number of Bidders. (Please refer to
para above also regarding receipt of a single offer).
e) the Bids’/Proposals’ prices are substantially higher than the updated cost
estimate or available budget;

77

As stated under para 11.8 of OM No.F.1/1/2021-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 20.10.2021

133

f)

If the bidder, whose bid has been found to be the lowest evaluated bid
withdraws or whose bid has been accepted, fails to sign the procurement
contract as may be required, or fails to provide the security as may be
required for the performance of the contract or otherwise withdraws from the
procurement process, the Procuring Entity shall re-tender the case78.

ii) Approval for re-tendering should be accorded by the CA after recording the
reasons/proper justification in writing. The decision of the procuring entity to cancel
the procurement and reasons for such a decision shall be immediately
communicated to all bidders that participated in the procurement process. Before
retendering, the procuring entity is first to check whether, while floating/issuing the
enquiry, all necessary requirements and formalities such as standard conditions,
industry friendly qualification criteria, and technical and commercial terms, wide
publicity, sufficient time for bidding, and so on, were fulfilled. If not, a fresh enquiry is
to be issued after rectifying the deficiencies.
7.5.12 Handling Dissent among Tender Committee
Tender Committee duties are to be discharged personally by the nominated officers. They
may take help of their subordinate officers by way of reports/ evaluations, but they would still
be answerable for such decisions. TC members cannot co-opt or nominate others to attend
deliberations on their behalf. TC deliberations are best held across the table and not through
circulation of notes.
All members of the TC should resolve their differences through personal discussions instead
of making to and fro references in writing. In cases where it is not possible to come to a
consensus and differences persist amongst TC members, the reasons for dissent of a
member should be recorded in a balanced manner along with the majority’s views on the
dissent note. The final recommendations should be that of the majority view. However, such
situations should be rare. The Competent Authority (CA) can overrule such dissent notes
after recording reasons for doing so clearly. His decision would be final.
In cases where the CA does not agree with the majority or unanimous recommendations of
the TC, he should record his views and, if possible, firstly send it back to TC to reconsider
along the lines of the tender accepting authority’s views. However, if the TC, after
considering the views of the CA, sticks to its own earlier recommendations, the CA can
finally decide as deemed fit, duly recording detailed reasons. He will be responsible for such
decisions. However, such situations should be rare.
7.5.13 Independence, Impartiality, Confidentiality and ‘No Conflict of Interest’ at all
Stages of Evaluation of Bids
All technical, commercial and finance officials who have contributed to the technocommercial or financial evaluation of bids, even though they may not be part of the TC
should deal with the procurement in an independent, impartial manner and should have no
conflict of interest with any of the bidder involved in the procurement. They should also
maintain confidentiality of the information processed during the evaluation process and not
allow it to reach any unauthorised person. They should sign a declaration at the end of their

78

Notified vide OM No. F.1/1/2021-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 21.04.2022

134

reports/notings stating that, “I declare that I have no conflict of interest with any of the bidder
in this tender”. TC members may make such a declaration at the end of their reports.
7.5.14 Tender Committee Recommendations/Report
The TC has to make formal recommendations (Annexure 11)for the award of the contract to
the bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive and the lowest
evaluated bid, provided further that the bidder is determined to be qualified to perform the
contract satisfactorily and his credentials have been verified. It is a good practice that TC
should spell out salient terms and conditions of the offer(s) recommended for acceptance. It
should also be ensured by the TC that any deviation/variation quoted by the supplier in his
bid are not left undiscussed and ruled upon in the TC; otherwise there may be delay in
acceptance of the contract by the supplier. These recommendations are submitted for
approval to the tender accepting authority. Since a nominee of Financial Adviser of the
Department is usually a member of the Tender Committee, there is no need for the CA to
consult the FA of the Department before accepting the TC recommendations. In any
purchase decision, the responsibility of the CA is not discharged merely by selecting the
cheapest offer or accepting TC recommendations but ensuring whether:

i) Offers have been invited in accordance with this manual and after following fair and
reasonable procedures in prevailing circumstances;

ii) He is satisfied that the selected offer will adequately meet the requirement for which
it is being procured;

iii) The price of the offer is reasonable and consistent with the quality required; and
iv) The accepted offer is the most appropriate taking all relevant factors into account in
keeping with the standards of financial propriety.
After the acceptance of these recommendations by the tender accepting authority, the Letter
(Notification) of Award (LoA) can be issued.

7.6

Award of Contract

7.6.1 LoA to Successful Bidder
Prior to the expiry of the period of bid validity, the successful bidder will be notified (briefly
indicating therein relevant details such as quantity, specification of the goods ordered,
prices, and so on) in writing by a registered letter or any other acknowledgeable and fool
proof method that his bid has been accepted. Legally communication of acceptance of offer
is considered complete as soon as it is submitted to Postal authorities (please refer to Para
2.9.1 of Appendix 2). A template for the Letter of Acceptance (or Notice of Award, or
Acceptance of Tender) is given in Annexure 14. In the same communication, the successful
tenderer is to be instructed to furnish the required performance security within a specified
period (generally 14(fourteen) days).
In respect of contracts for purchases valued Rupees two and a half lakh and above, where
tender documents include the GCC, SCC and schedule of requirements, the letter of
acceptance will result in a binding contract. All delivery liabilities would be counted from the
date of LoA.
7.6.2 Publication of Tender Results and Return of EMD of Unsuccessful Bidders
[Rule 173 (xviii) of GFR 2017]

135

The details of award of contract and name of the successful tenderer should be mentioned
mandatorily on the CPPP and also in the notice board/bulletin/website of the concerned
Ministry or Department/e-Procurement Portal. In case publication of such information is
sensitive from commercial or security aspects, dispensation may be sought from publishing
of such results by obtaining sanction from the Secretary of the Department with the
concurrence if associated Finance. Upon the successful bidder furnishing the signed
agreement and performance security, each unsuccessful bidder will be promptly notified and
their bid security be returned without interest within 30 (thirty) days of notice of award of
contract. The successful supplier’s bid security shall be adjusted against the SD or returned
as per the terms of the tender documents. In cases, where PSUs compete with private firms in
public tenders, publication of details of contracts awarded by the PSU concerned to various subvendors, suppliers, technology providers and other associates before firming up their offer, may
hurt the interest of the PSU as the competitors may get to know the details of sub-venders,
suppliers, technology providers and other associates as well as the price at which the contracts
are placed. Therefore, in such cases, publication of details of contracts awarded may be
dispensed with.
7.6.3 Bidder’s right to question rejection at this stage
A tenderer shall have the right to be heard in case he feels that a proper procurement
process is not being followed and/or his tender has been rejected wrongly. The tenderer is to
be permitted to send his representation in writing. Bidding documents should explicitly
mention the name, designation and contact details of officers nominated to receive
representations in this regard. But, such representation has to be sent within 10(ten) days
from the date of LoA. The procuring entity should ensure a decision within 15 (fifteen) days
of the receipt of the representation. Only a directly affected bidder can represent in this
regard:

i) Only a bidder who has participated in the concerned procurement process i.e. prequalification, bidder registration or bidding, as the case may be, can make such
representation

ii) In case pre-qualification bid has been evaluated before the bidding of Technical/
financial bids, an application for review in relation to the technical/ financial bid may
be filed only by a bidder has qualified in pre-qualification bid;

iii) In case technical bid has been evaluated before the opening of the financial bid, an
application for review in relation to the financial bid may be filed only by a bidder
whose technical bid is found to be acceptable

iv) Following decisions of the procuring entity in accordance with the provision of internal
guidelines shall not be subject to review:
a)

f)

Determination of the need for procurement;
Selection of the mode of procurement or bidding system;
Choice of selection procedure;
Provisions limiting participation of bidders in the procurement process;
The decision to enter into negotiations with the L1 bidder;
Cancellation of the procurement process except where it is intended to
subsequently re-tender the same requirements;

136

g) Issues related to ambiguity in contract terms may not be taken up after a contract
has been signed, all such issues should be highlighted before consummation of
the contract by the vendor/contractor; and
h) Complaints against specifications except under the premise that they are either
vague or too specific so as to limit competition may be permissible.
7.6.4 Performance Security
The supplier receiving the LoA is required to furnish the required performance security, if it is
part of tender conditions, in the prescribed form by the specified date; failing this necessary
action including forfeiture of EMD will be taken against the supplier.
7.6.5 Acknowledgement of Contract by Successful Bidder and Execution
After the successful bidder is notified that his bid has been accepted, he will be sent an
agreement for signature and return, incorporating all agreements between the parties.
The supplier should acknowledge and unconditionally accept, sign, date and return the
agreement within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of issue of the contract in case of OTE
and 28 (twenty-eight) days in case of GTE. Such acknowledgements may not be required in
low value contracts, below Rupees two and a half Lakh or when the bidders offer has been
accepted in entirety, without any modifications. While acknowledging the contract, the
supplier may raise issues and/or ask for modifications against some entries in the contract;
such aspects shall be immediately be looked into for necessary action and, thereafter, the
supplier’s unconditional acceptance of the contract obtained. If both parties (Procuring Entity
and the supplier) simultaneously sign the contract across the table, further
acknowledgement from the supplier is not required. It should also be made known to the
successful tenderer that in case he does not furnish the required performance security or
does not accept the contract within the stipulated target dates, such non-compliance will
constitute sufficient ground for forfeiture of its EMD and processing the case for further
action against it (the successful tenderer).
All contracts shall be signed and entered into after receipt and verification of the requisite
performance security, by an authority empowered to do so by or under the orders of the
President of India in terms of Article 299 (1) of the Constitution of India. The words “for and
on behalf of the President of India” should follow the designation appended below the
signature of the officer authorised on this behalf. The various classes of contracts and
assurances of property, which may be executed by different authorities, are specified in the
DFPR. No contract on behalf of an organisation of Procuring Entity should be entered into by
any authority which has not been empowered to do so under the orders of the state
Government.
7.6.6 Framing of Contract
The following general principles should be observed while entering into contracts:

i) Any agreement shall be issued strictly as per approved TC recommendations, be vetted
by the Associated/ integrated Finance and approved by CA. The terms of contract must
be precise, definite and without any ambiguities. The terms should not involve an
uncertain or indefinite liability, except in the case of a cost plus contract or where there is
PVC in the contract. In other words, no contract involving an uncertain or indefinite

137

liability or any condition of an unusual character should be entered into without the
previous consent of the Associated/ integrated Finance.
ii) All contracts shall contain a provision for
a) Recovery of liquidated damages (LD) for delay in performance of the contract on
the part of the contractor;
b) A warranty clause/defect liability clause should be incorporated in contracts for
plant and machinery, above a threshold value, requiring the contractor to, without
charge, replace, repair or rectify defective goods/ works/services;

iii) All contracts for supply of goods should reserve the right of the Government to reject
goods which do not conform to the specifications;

iv) Payment of all applicable taxes by the contractor or supplier; and
v) When a contract is likely to endure for a period of more than two years, it should,
wherever feasible, include a provision for an unconditional power of revocation or
cancellation by the Government at any time on the expiry of six months’ notice to that
effect.

vi) Standard forms of contracts should be invariably adopted, except in following cases:
a) Authorities competent to make purchases may, at their discretion, make
purchases of value up to Rupees two and a half lakh by issuing purchase
orders containing basic terms and conditions;
b) In cases where standard forms of contracts are not used or where
modifications in standard forms are considered necessary in respect of
individual contracts, legal and financial advice should be taken in drafting the
clauses in the contract and approval of CAs is to be obtained; and
c) Copies of all contracts and agreements for purchases of the value of Rs. 25
(Rupees twenty-five) lakh and above, and of all rate and running contracts
entered into by civil Departments of the Government should be sent to the
Accountant General.
7.6.7 Procurement Records
The Procurement file should start with the Indent and related documents. All subsequent
documents relating to procurement planning; Copy of Bid Document and documents relating
to its and formulation, publishing and issue/ uploading; Bid Opening; Bids received;
Correspondence and documents (including Technical Evaluation and TC report) relating to
pre-qualification, evaluation, Award of Contract; and finally the Contract copy, should be kept
on the file. In case of bulky Bids received, all bids received may be kept in a separate
volume, with a copy of accepted bids later being put on the main volume. To maintain
integrity of the records relating to Procurement, these files should be kept secure and for
contract management a new volume of file may be opened to obviate frequent exposure of
sensitive procurement file. In contract management volume, copies of successful bid, Tender
Committee Report, Contract may also be kept for ready reference, besides correspondence
and documents relating to Contract Management and its closure.

conspiring firms continue to bid but they
agree to take turns being the winning (i.e.,
lowest qualifying) bidder in a group of
tenders of a similar nature.

market and agree not to give competitive
bids for certain customers or in certain
geographic areas.

These strategies, in turn, may result in
patterns that procurement officials can
detect and steps can be taken to thwart such
attempts. Such anti-competitive activities
come under the purview of the competition
law, where there is provision of stringent
penalties. Regular training should be held for
officers involved in procurement to detect
and mitigate such practices and also use of
the competition law against such bidders.

Chapter 8: Rate Contract and other Procurements with special
features
8.1

Rate Contracts

8.1.1 Definition: A Rate Contract (commonly known as RC) is an agreement between the
purchaser and the supplier for supply of specified goods (and allied services, if any) at
specified price and terms & conditions (as incorporated in the agreement) during the period
covered by the Rate Contract. No quantity is mentioned nor is any minimum drawal
guaranteed in the Rate Contract. The Rate Contract is in the nature of a standing offer from
the supplier firm. The firm and/or the purchaser are entitled to withdraw/cancel the Rate
Contract by serving an appropriate notice on each other giving 15 (fifteen) days time.
However, once a supply order is placed on the supplier for supply of a definite quantity in
terms of the rate contract during the validity period of the rate contract, that supply order
becomes a valid and binding contract.
8.1.2 Merits of Rate Contract-The Rate Contract system provides various benefits to both
the Purchaser (i.e. user) and the Supplier and the same are indicated below:
i)

Benefit to Users
a) Competitive and economical price due to aggregation of demands.
b) Saves time, efforts, man-hours and related costs involved in time consuming as
well as repetitive tendering process. It thus reduces lead time for procurement.
c) Availability of quality goods with full quality assurance back-up.
d) Enables procurement as and when required and thus reduces inventory carrying
cost.
e) Advantageous even to small users and those located in remote areas.
f) Provides one single point of contact to procure such items.

ii) Benefit to Suppliers:
a) Reduces marketing cost and efforts.
b) Eliminates repetitive tendering and follow-up actions with multiple authorities.
c) Provides single point contact for Govt. supplies.
d) Aggregation of Govt. demand leads to economic production.
e) Lends credibility.
f) Promotes quality discipline.

8.1.7 Period of Rate Contract: The period of a Rate Contract should normally be one
year for stable technology products. However, in special cases, shorter or longer period not
more than two years may be considered. As far as possible, validity period of rate contracts
should be fixed in such a way as to ensure that budgetary levies would not affect the price

141

and thereby frustrate the contracts. Attempts should also be made to suitably stagger the
period of rate contracts throughout the year.
8.1.8

Deleted

8.1.9 Special Conditions applicable for Rate Contract- Some conditions of rate contract
differ from the usual conditions applicable for ad hoc contracts. Some such important special
conditions of rate contract are given below:
i)

ii)
In the Schedule of Requirement, no quantity is mentioned; only the
anticipated drawl is mentioned without any commitment.
iii)
The purchaser reserves the right to conclude one or more than one rate contract for
the same item.
iv)
The purchaser as well as the supplier may withdraw the rate contract by serving
suitable notice to each other. The prescribed notice period is generally fifteen days.
v)
The purchaser has the option to renegotiate the price with the rate contract holders.
vi)
In case of emergency, the purchaser may purchase the same item through ad hoc
contract with a new supplier.
vii)
The purchaser and the authorized users of the rate contract are entitled to place
online supply orders up to the last day of the validity of the rate contract and, though
supplies against such supply orders will be effected beyond the validity period of the
rate contract, all such supplies will be guided by the terms & conditions of the rate
contract.
viii)
The rate contract will be guided by “Fall Clause” (as described later in this chapter).
8.1.10
Parallel Rate Contracts: Since, the rate contracts concluded are to take
care of the demands of various Departments and Organizations, PSUs, Autonomous
Organizations etc. spread all over the country, generally a single supplier does not have
enough capacity to cater to the entire demand of an item. Therefore, the rate contracts are
concluded with different suppliers for the same item. Such rate contracts are known as
Parallel Rate Contracts.
8.1.11
Conclusion of Rate Contracts including Parallel Rate ContractsTechniques for conclusion of rate contract is basically identical to that of ad hoc contract (as
discussed in Chapter 7 of the Manual). Identical tender documents may be utilized for
conclusion of rate contracts subject to inclusion therein the special terms & conditions as
applicable for rate contracts. In the first instance, the rate contract is to be awarded to the
lowest responsive tenderer (L1). However, depending on the anticipated demand of the item,
location of the users, capacity of the responsive bidders, reasonableness of the prices
quoted by the responsive bidders, etc. it may become necessary to award parallel rate
contracts also. Efforts should be made to conclude parallel rate contracts with suppliers
located in different parts of the country. For the sake of transparency and to avoid any
criticism, all such parallel rate contracts are to be issued simultaneously.
8.1.12 Deleted
8.1.13 Cartel Formation / Pool Rates/Bid rigging/Collusive bidding etc.: Quoting of pool
rates/Cartel formation, bid rigging/collusive bidding is against the basic principle of
competitive bidding and defeats the very purpose of open and competitive tendering system.
Such practices should be severely discouraged with strong measures. Suitable
administrative actions like rejecting the offers, reporting the matter to Competition
Commission of India, , on case to case basis, as decided by the competent authority.
Ministries/Departments may also bring such unhealthy practice to the notice of the

142

concerned trade associations like FICCI, ASSOCHAM, NSIC, etc. requesting them, inter
alia, to take suitable strong actions against such firms. The Ministries/Departments may also
encourage new firms to get themselves registered to break the monopolistic attitude of the
firms giving pool rate/ forming cartel. Purchaser may also debar the tenderers indulging in
cartel formation/collusive bidding/bid rigging for a period of two years from participation in
the tenders of the Purchaser.
8.1.14 Fall Clause: Fall clause is a price safety mechanism in rate contracts. The fall clause
provides that if the rate contract holder reduces its price or sells or even offers to sell the rate
contracted goods or services following conditions of sale similar to those of the rate contract,
at a price lower than the rate contract price, to any person or organization during the
currency of the rate contract, the rate contract price will be automatically reduced with effect
from that date for all the subsequent supplies under the rate contract and the rate contract
amended accordingly. Other parallel rate contract holders, if any, are also to be given
opportunity to reduce their price as well, by notifying the reduced price to them and giving
them 07 (seven) days time to intimate their revised prices, if they so desire, in sealed cover
to be opened in public on the specified date and time and further action taken as per
standard practice. On many occasions, the parallel rate contract holders attempt to grab
more orders by unethical means by announcing reduction of their price (after getting the rate
contract) under the guise of Fall Clause. This situation is also to be dealt with in similar
manner as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It is however, very much necessary that
the purchase organizations keep special watch on the performance of such rate contract
holders who reduce their prices on one pretext or other. If their performances are not up to
the mark, appropriately severe action should be taken against them including deregistering
them, suspending business deals with them, debarring them for two years from participating
against the tender enquiry floated by concerned purchase organization etc.
The provisions of fall clause will however not apply to the following:
i) Export/Deemed Export by the supplier;
ii) Sale of goods or services as original equipment prices lower than the price charged
for normal replacement;
iii) Sale of goods such as drugs, which have expiry date;
iv) Sale of goods or services at lower price on or after the date of completion of
sale/placement of order of goods or services by the authority concerned, under the
existing or previous Rate Contracts as also under any previous contracts entered into
with the Central or State Government Departments including new undertakings
(excluding joint sector companies and or private parties) and bodies.
8.1.15 Performance Security: Depending on the anticipated overall drawal against a rate
contract and, also, anticipated number of parallel rate contracts to be issued for an item,
Department shall consider obtaining Performance Security @ 5% (five percent) of the value
of supply order in the supply orders issued against rate contracts on the rate contract holder.
8.1.16 Renewal of Rate Contracts: It should be ensured that new rate contracts are made
operative right after the expiry of the existing rate contracts without any gap for all rate
contracted items. In case, however, it is not possible to conclude new rate contracts due to
some special reasons, timely steps are to be taken to extend the existing rate contracts with
same terms, conditions etc. for a suitable period, with the consent of the rate contract
holders. Rate contracts of the firms, who do not agree to such extension, are to be left out.

143

Also, while extending the existing rate contracts, it shall be ensured that the price trend is not
lower.

in

urgencies/

Emergencies

and

Disaster

There are sufficient fast track procurement modalities to tackle procurements in urgent/
emergent and Disaster Management situations. Enhanced delegations of procurement
powers in SoPP may be considered to handle such situations. Use of following modes of
procurements may be utilised in order of speed(under Disaster Management situations,
threshold limits of modes of procurement may be increased for higher level of officers, with
the sanction of Secretary of the Department):
i) Direct Procurement Without Quotation
ii) Direct Procurement by Purchase Committee
iii) SLTE/ Limited/ Single Tender Enquiry, with reduced time for submission of Bids
To speed up procurement, advance cash may be drawn for direct procurement modes and
made available to the Committees/ officer, with accounts and vouchers to be submitted after
purchase.

8.3

Buy Back Offer

When it is decided to replace an existing old item(s) with a new/better version, the
Department may trade the existing old item while purchasing the new one by issuing suitable
bidding documents for this purpose. The condition of the old item, its location and the mode
of its handing over to the successful bidder are also to be incorporated in the bidding
document. Further, the bidder should be asked to quote the prices for the item (to be offered
by them) with rebate for the old item and also, without any rebate (in case they do not want
to lift the old item). This will enable the Department either to trade or not to trade the old item
while purchasing the new one.(Rule 176 of GFR 2017)

8.4

Capital Goods/ Equipment (Machinery and Plant – M&P)

Capital goods are Machinery and Plant (M&P) which create new Fixed Assets/ utility/
functionality or benefit to the organisation and has a long useful life. Special features of
procurement of Capital Goods are:

i) Since the cost is generally high, there are detailed procedures for approval of
technical, administrative and budgetary provisions – before an indent is generated.
Unlike consumable items (which are procured if a non-specific budgetary provision is
there), Capital Goods are procured after an item specific Budgetary provision is
included in the budget. Thus the acquisition of Capital Goods is also an Investment
decision and may require some form of Investment Justification. Some of the higher
value Capital Goods may be accounted in the Capital Block of the Organization.
However these features may not apply to Capital goods procurement of smaller
threshold values;
ii) There are also alternative to outright purchasing/ owning such equipment like hiring/
hire-purchase/ leasing or acquiring the functionality as a service;
iii) The procurement involves elements of Works and Services like Installation,
Commissioning, Training, prolonged trials, Warranty, After Sales Services like post-

144

warranty Maintenance and assured availability of spares. All such elements have
costs may be quoted explicitly or implicitly. A suitable warranty clause should indicate
the period of warranty and service levels as well as penalties for delays in restoration
of defects. Clauses for including essential initial spares for two years’ maintenance to
be supplied along with equipment may be provided. If necessary appropriate number
of years’ (say three to five or more years depending on the lifespan of the equipment)
AMC may be included in the procurement detailing its conditions;
iv) The cost of operations, maintenance and disposal of the equipment over its life cycle
may far outweigh the initial procurement cost over the life cycle of the capital
equipment. Hence value for money becomes an important consideration – which can
be addressed in Public Procurement by way of appropriate Description, specification,
Contract conditions like inclusion of cost of supply of initial essential spares and total
present value (as per DCF technique) of Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) for
specified number of years within the estimated cost and also the evaluation criteria of
procurement contract;
v) In case the Plant and Equipment consists of a number of machines which work in
tandem or if it includes services/ works to be done by third party, an all
encompassing Turnkey contract may be better alternative;
vi) Because of complexity of specification evaluation of Technical suitability of offers in
procurement of Capital Goods involves complex issues about acceptance of
alternatives, deviations and compliance with various particulars of specification.
Acceptance or otherwise of alternatives should be made explicit. A statement of
deviation including detailed justification for the deviations from each clause of
specification should be asked for from the bidder in the Bid documents. A schedule of
Guaranteed Particulars of specification indicating the values of each parameter may
be included in the Specification, where the bidder can quote the offered value of the
Parameters. In complex cases Pre-bid conference may help in reducing disputes and
complexity at the time of evaluation;
vii) Past experience, Capacity and Financial strength of a supplier is an important
determinant of quality, after sales support of the Capital Goods; such procurements
are a fit case for Pre-Qualification bidding.

8.5

Turnkey Contract

In the context of procurement of goods, a turnkey contract may include the manufacture,
supply, assembly, installation/ commissioning of equipment (or a group of plant and
machines working in tandem – even though some of the machines may not be manufactured
by the supplier himself) and some incidental works or services. Generally, in the tender
enquiry documents for a turn key contract, the purchase organization specifies the
performance and output required from the plant proposed to be set up and broadly outlines
the various parameters it visualizes for the desired plant. The inputs and other facilities,
which the purchase organization will provide to the contractor, are also indicated in the
tender enquiry document. The contractor is to design the plant and quote accordingly. The
responsibility of the contractor will include supplying the required goods, machinery,
equipment etc. needed for the plant; assembling, installing and erecting the same at site as
needed; commissioning the plant to meet the required output etc., as specified in the tender
enquiry documents.

8.6

Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)
145

i) Some goods, especially sophisticated equipment and machinery need proper
maintenance for trouble-free service. For this purpose, the purchase organisation
may enter into a maintenance contract. It must, however, be kept in mind that
maintenance contract is to start after the expiry of the warranty period, during which
period the goods are to be maintained free of cost by the supplier.

ii) The maintenance contract may be entered into either with the manufacturer/supplier
of the goods or with a competent and eligible firm, not necessarily the
manufacturer/supplier of the goods in question. The purchase organisation should
decide this aspect on case to case basis on merit.

iii) If the maintenance contract is to be entered into with the supplier of the goods, then
suitable clauses for this purpose are to be incorporated in the tender enquiry
document itself and while evaluating the offers, the cost component towards
maintenance of the goods for specified number of years is also to be added in the
evaluated tender value on overall basis to decide the inter se ranking of the
responsive tenderers. Equipment with a lower quoted price may carry a higher
maintenance liability. Therefore, the total cost on purchase and maintenance of the
equipment over the period of the maintenance contract should be assessed to
consider its suitability for purchase. While evaluating the tenderers for maintenance
of goods covering a longer period (say, three to five or more years depending on the
life-span of the equipment), the quoted prices pertaining to maintenance in future
years are to be discounted (as per DCF technique) to the net present value as
appropriate for comparing the tenders on an equitable basis and deciding the lowest
evaluated responsive tender.

iv) However, if the maintenance contract is to be entered into with a competent and
eligible supplier separately, then a separate tender enquiry is to be floated for this
purpose and tenders evaluated and ranked accordingly for placement of the
maintenance contract. Here, the supplier of the goods may also quote and his
quotation, if received, is to be considered along with other quotations received.

v) The details of the services required for maintenance of the goods, the required period
of maintenance and other relevant terms and conditions, including payment terms,
are to be incorporated in the tender enquiry document. The terms of payment for the
maintenance service will depend on the nature of the goods to be maintained as well
as the nature of the services desired. Generally, payment for maintenance is made
on a half-yearly or quarterly basis.

vi) A Service Level Agreement (SLA) may be incorporated in complex and large
maintenance contracts. SLA should indicate guaranteed levels of service parameters
like - %age uptime to be ensured; Performance output levels to be ensured from the
equipment; channel of registering service request; response time for resolving the
request, Channel for escalation of service request in case of delay or unsatisfactory
resolution of request, monitoring of Service Levels etc. This would include provision
of help lines, complaint registration and escalation procedures, response time,
percentage of uptime and availability of equipment, non-degradation in performance
levels after maintenance, maintenance of an inventory of common spares, use of
genuine spares, and so on. The maintenance contract may also include penalties

146

(liquidated Damages) for unacceptable delays in responses and degradation in
performance output of machines, including provisions for terminations.

vii) It should be indicated in the bid documents, whether the maintenance charges would
be inclusive of visiting charges, price of spares (many times, consumables such as
rubber gasket, bulbs, and so on, are not included, even though major parts may be
included), price of consumables (fuel, lubricants, cartridges, and so on). If costs of
spares are to be borne by the procuring entity, then a guaranteed price list should be
asked for along with the bids. It should also be clarified, whether room/space,
electricity, water connection, and so on, would be provided free of cost to the
contractor. The bidding document should also lay down a service level agreement to
ensure proper service during the maintenance period.

viii)A suitable provision should be incorporated in the tender enquiry document and in
the resultant maintenance contract indicating that the prices charged by the
maintenance contractor should not exceed the prevailing rates charged by him from
others for similar services. While claiming payment, the contractor is also to give a
certificate to this effect in his bill.

ix) If the goods to be maintained are sophisticated and costly, the tender enquiry
document should also have a provision for obtaining performance security. The
amount of performance security will depend on the nature of the goods, period of
maintenance, and so on. It generally varies from two and a half to five per cent of the
value of the equipment to be maintained.

x) Sometimes, the maintenance contractor may have to take the goods or some
components of the goods to his factory for repair, and so on. On such occasions,
before handing over the goods or components, valuing more than Rupees One Lakh,
a suitable bank guarantee is to be obtained from the firm to safeguard the
purchaser's interest.

xi) Sometimes, during the tenure of a maintenance contract, especially with a longer
tenure, it may become necessary for the purchase organisation to withdraw the
maintenance contract due to some unforeseen reasons. To take care of this, there
should be a suitable provision in the tender document and in the resultant contract.
Depending on the cost and nature of the goods to be maintained, a suitable notice
period (say one to three months) for such cancellation to come into effect is to be
provided in the documents. A model clause to this effect is provided below:
"The purchaser reserves its right to terminate the maintenance contract at any
time after giving due notice without assigning any reason. The contractor will not
be entitled to claim any compensation against such termination. However, while
terminating the contract, if any payment is due to the contractor for maintenance
services already performed in terms of the contract, these would be paid to it/him
as per the contract terms".

Chapter 9: Contract Management
9.1

Contract Management

9.1.1 The Purpose of Contract Management
The purpose of contract management is to ensure that the contract delivers the desired
outcomes as per the terms and conditions of the contract. It also ensures that the payments
made to the contractor match the performance. Implementation of the contract should be
strictly monitored and notices issued promptly whenever a breach of provisions occurs.
Monitoring should ensure that contractor adhere to contract terms, performance
expectations are achieved (such as timely deliveries, quality of goods supplied, adherence to
proper procedure for submitting invoices, and so on) and any problems are identified and
resolved in a timely manner. Without a sound monitoring process, there can be no
assurance that “we get what we pay and contract for and pay for only for what we get”.
Normally, the following issues are handled during this phase:

i)
ii)
iii)

Amendments to the contract;
Operation of the option clause;
Safeguards for handing over Procuring Entity materials/equipment to
contractors;
iv) Payments to the contractor and handling of securities;
v) Monitoring of supplier performance;
vi) Delays in performance of the contract;
vii) Breach of contract, remedies and termination of contract;
viii) Dispute resolution;
ix) Contract closure upon completion;
x) Goods receiving;
xi) Quality assurance;
xii) Accountal and payment of bills; and
xiii) Storage and issue of inspected goods.
9.1.2 Costs of delay in Contract Management Decisions: Delays
Payments and decisions in contract management requested by the suppliers should be
made within a reasonable time. An atmosphere of lackadaisical dilatory functioning in such
matters is liable to lead to bidders quoting higher prices in future bids, besides delays in
supplies and disputes in the contract.

9.2

Amendment to the Contract

Once a contract has been concluded, the terms and conditions thereof should not be varied.
No amendment to the contract should be made that can lead to a vitiation of the original
tender decision or bestow an undue advantage on the contractor. However, due to various
reasons, changes and modifications are needed in the contract. Where it becomes
necessary/ inescapable, any modification will be carried out with the prior approval of the CA
with the Associated/ integrated Finance’s concurrence.
Requests for such changes and modifications mostly emanate from the supplier. Any
amendment to the contract may have, inter alia, financial/technical/legal implications. The

148

indenter may be consulted regarding the technical implications. Financial concurrence
should be obtained before issuing any amendment that has financial
implications/repercussions. Further, if considered necessary, legal opinion may also be
sought.
An amendment can concern any of the clauses of the contract but, in supply contracts,
amendments often relate to the following:
i) Increase or decrease in the quantity required, exercise of quantity option clause;
ii) Changes in schedule of deliveries and terms of delivery;
iii) Changes in inspection arrangements;
iv) Changes in terms of payments and statutory levies; and
v) Change due to any other situation not anticipated.
Post contract variation carried out in the form of an amendment shall be published by the
purchaser on the same e-procurement portals/Websites that were used for publication of the
original tender enquiry. No change in the price quoted shall be permitted after the purchase
order has been issued, except on account of price variation, ERV and statutory variations.

9.3

Operation of Option Clause

9.3.1 Option Clause
Under this clause, the purchaser retains the right to place orders for an additional quantity up
to a specified percentage of the originally contracted quantity at the same rate and terms of
the contract, during the currency of the contract. This clause and percentage should be part
of the Bid Document and the contract and ideally should not exceed 25-30%. Approval
should be taken from the CA (who originally approved the tender decision) to exercise the
option clause based on the value of the contract with the increased quantity. In case the
recalculated value of the contract goes beyond the delegation of powers of the original CA,
approval of the CA for the enhanced value may be taken.
Normally, for raw materials/consumables of regular and year-on-year recurrent
requirements, all tenders of value above Rs. 50 (Rupees fifty) lakh should invariably include
this clause. However, the CA may approve the inclusion of such a clause in lower
denomination tenders if such items have a history of frequent disruptions in continuity of
supplies. The clause may be framed along following lines:
“The purchaser reserves the right to increase/decrease the ordered quantity by up to [25]per
cent at any time, till final delivery date (or the extended delivery date of the contract), by
giving reasonable notice even though the quantity ordered initially has been supplied in full
before the last date of the delivery period (or the extended delivery period).”

9.3.2 Conditions Governing Operation of Option Clause
Additional demands should be available for coverage and over-provisioning may be avoided
by keeping the officers concerned with provisioning/tender evaluation for the next cycle of
procurement informed. The following points must be kept in mind while operating the option
clause:
In case of decrease in the ordered quantity, it would be fair to allow the firm to supply
work-in-progress or goods already put up for inspection;
ii) There should be no declining trend in the price of the stores as evidenced from the
fact that no order has since been placed at lower rates and no tender has been
i)

149

opened since the time offers have been received at lower rates – even if not
finalised;
iii) If the option clause exists, during provisioning of the next cycle and during tender
evaluation in the next cycle of procurement, application of the option clause must be
positively taken into account. The contract management authority must also keep a
watch on delivery against contract, if other conditions are satisfied, the option clause
must be exercised;
iv) The option clause is normally exercised after receipt of 50 (fifty) per cent quantity but
if the delivery period is going to expire and other conditions are fulfilled, it can be
exercised even earlier;
v) The option clause shall be exercised during the currency of the contract such that the
contractor has reasonable time/notice for executing such an increase and can be
exercised even if the original ordered quantity is completed before the original last
date of delivery. If not already agreed upon, the delivery period shall be fixed for the
additional quantity on the lines of the delivery period in the original order. This will
satisfy the requirement of giving reasonable notice to the supplier to exercise the
option clause;
vi) The quantum of the option clause will be excluded from the value of tenders for the
purpose of determining the level of CA in the original tender;
vii) There should be no option clause in development orders;
viii) This provision can also be exercised in case of PAC/single supplier OEM cases; and
ix) However, where parallel contracts on multiple suppliers are available, care should be
taken in exercising the option clause, so that the original tender decision of splitting
quantities and differential pricing is not upset or vitiated. Other things being equal, the
supplier with the lower rate should first be considered for the option quantity.

9.4

Safeguards for Handing over Procuring Entity Materials/Equipment to
Contractors
For performance of certain contracts, Procuring Entity may have to loan stores, drawings,
documents, equipment and assets (such as accommodation, identity cards and gate passes,
and so on) to the contractor. In certain situations, the contractor may also be supplied
electricity, water, cranes, and weighing facilities on payment/hire basis. As a measure of
transparency, the possibility of provision of such resources by Procuring Entity should have
been announced in the tender document or at least requested by the contractor in the tender
and written in the contract. Whenever stores or prototypes or sub-assemblies are required to
be issued to the firm/contractor for guidance in fabrication, these should be issued against
an appropriate bank guarantee. In addition to the bank guarantee, appropriate insurance
may be asked for if it is considered necessary. Before the final payment or release of
PBG/SD, a certificate may be taken from the concerned Department that the contractor has
returned all documents, drawings, protective gear, material, equipment, facilities and assets
loaned, including all ID cards and gate passes, and so on, in good condition. Further, it
should be certified that payment from the contractor has been received for usage of
electricity, water, crane, accommodation, weighing facility, and so on. For low value items of
less than Rs. 1,00,000 (Rupees One Lakh), or for sending spares for repairs to the OEMs,
this stipulation of the bank guarantee may be waived and, if feasible, an indemnity bond may
be taken.

150

9.5

Payments to the Contractor and Handling of Securities

9.5.1 It should be ensured that all payments due to the firm, including release of the
performance security, are made on a priority basis without avoidable delay as per the
tender/contract conditions. Before the payment is made, the invoice should be crosschecked with the actual receipt of material to ensure that the payment matches the actual
performance.
9.5.2 Proper procedures for safe custody, monitoring and return of bank guarantees and
other instruments may be followed. Chapter 6 has more details in this regard. Before making
a final payment or before releasing the performance bank guarantee, a ‘No Claim Certificate’
(Annexure 21) may be insisted upon from the supplier to prevent future claims. Whenever a
bank guarantee is released following due procedure and safeguards, acknowledgement
thereof should also be taken from the contractor.
9.5.3 Delay in payment to the contractors: Public authorities may put in place a
provision for payment of interest in case of delayed payment of bills by more than 30 working
days after submission of bill by the contractor. Where interest is to be paid, the rate of
interest should be the rate of interest of General Provident Fund.
In case of unwarranted discretionary delays in payments, as prescribed above, responsibility
shall be fixed on the concerned officers. There should have a system to monitor delays in
payments and to identify such unwarranted delays including an online system for monitoring
of the bills submitted by contractors. Such system shall have the facility for contractors to
track the status of their bills. It shall be mandatory for all contractors bills to be entered into
the system with date of submission and date of payment.

9.6

Monitoring of Supplier Performance

As soon as the order is issued, entry shall be made in the progress of supply order register
(Annexure 17) recording therein the name of the supplier, items, rate, quantity, amount,
delivery schedule, and so on. Monitoring should ensure that suppliers adhere to contract
terms, performance expectations are achieved (such as timely deliveries, quality of goods
supplied, and adherence to proper procedure for submitting invoices, and so on) and any
problems are identified and resolved in a timely manner. Without a sound monitoring
process, there can be no assurance that the buyer has received what was contracted. A
sound system for monitoring the performance of the suppliers in a contract would also be
useful in selecting a good supplier in future procurement of the same or similar materials.
Purchase order-wise data will be maintained in this register regarding execution by and
performance of the supplier. The register shall form the basis for the Management
Information System report on unexecuted purchase orders beyond scheduled deliveries,
reports on performance of suppliers, and so on.

9.7

Delays in Performance of Contract

9.7.1

Delivery Period

The period for delivery of the ordered goods and completion of any allied service(s) thereof
(such as installation and commissioning of the equipment, operators’ training, and so on) are
to be properly specified in the contract with definite dates and these shall be deemed to be
the essence of the contract. The delivery period stipulated in contracts should be specific
and practical. Vague and ambiguous terms such as 1,000/5,000 (one to five thousand)
numbers per month, 2to 16 (two to sixteen) weeks from the date of receipt of order,

151

‘immediate’, ‘ex-stock’, ‘as early as possible’, ‘off the shelf’, ‘approximately’ and the like
should be scrupulously avoided as these will not be legally binding.
In case of items such as raw material which is delivered throughout the year, a delivery
schedule of the monthly rate of supply should be specified. It is usual in such cases that
there is a slight deviation from such monthly rate of supply. It should be clarified in such
cases that the variation in the periodic rate of supply beyond +/- 10 (ten) per cent in any
calendar month; or +/- seven per cent cumulative in any calendar quarter; or +/- five per cent
cumulative in any calendar year would be considered as delay in delivery attracting
imposition of LD.
Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept the delivery thereof in
instalments.
9.7.2

Terms of Delivery

Terms of delivery (FOR, FOB, CIF, and CFR, and so on), inter alia, determine the delivery
point of the ordered goods from where the purchaser is to receive/collect the goods. It also
decides the legally important issue of when the ‘titles of the goods’ have passed to the
purchaser. The delivery period is to be read in conjunction with the terms of delivery,
therefore the delivery is taken to have been made at the time when goods reach the delivery
point as per the delivery terms. Chapter 6 has more details in this regard.
9.7.3

Severable and Entire Delivery Contracts

Such contracts, where instalments are not specified or not intended, are known as entire
contracts. In such cases, even non-delivery of a part quantity can lead to a breach of
contract. However, a variation of five per cent of the contract quantity is usually exempted in
the contract conditions. In the case of an entire contract, even if providing a delivery
schedule, it is not necessary to grant an extension in the delivery period in the case of delay
in intermediate instalments. Such extension would be necessary only in case of a delay
beyond the final date for the completion of the delivery.
Contracts with clearly laid out instalment deliveries mentioning the exact dates and where
each instalment is paid for separately are known as severable contracts. In effect, each of
such instalments is a separate independent contract by itself. In severable contracts, delay
or breach of one instalment does not affect other instalments, since each instalment is
considered as a separate contract. In the case of severable contracts, extension in the
delivery period is necessary for each instalment separately.
The legal position, however, is not very straightforward, since the mere mention of monthly/
quarterly rate of delivery, called delivery schedule, is not sufficient to make it a severable
contract. However, instalments specifying exact dates, that is, 310 (three hundred and ten)
numbers by June 20, 2016 would be amounting to a severable contract.
The delivery cannot be re-fixed to make a contract a 'severable' contract without the specific
agreement of the supplier, if the delivery originally stipulated in the contract was in the form
of an 'entire' contract.
9.7.4

Extension of Delivery

Suppliers shall be required to adhere to the delivery schedule specified in the purchase
order and, if there is delay in supplies, LD shall be levied wherever there is failure by the

152

party. Extension of the delivery date amounts to amendment of the contract. Such an
extension can be only done with the consent of both parties (that is, the purchaser and
supplier). No extension of the delivery date is to be granted suo motu unless the supplier
specifically asks for it. However, in a few cases, it may be necessary to grant an extension of
the delivery period suo motu in the interest of the administration. In such cases, it is legally
necessary to obtain clear acceptance of the extension letter from the supplier.
No correspondence should be entered into with the supplier after expiry of the contract
delivery period or towards the end of it, which has the legal effect of condoning the
delay/breach of contract. When it is necessary to obtain certain information regarding past
supplies, it should be made clear that calling for such information is not intended to keep the
contract alive and that it does not waive the breach and that it is without prejudice to the
rights and remedies available to the purchaser under the terms of the contract. The last line
of such a communication should therefore be: “This letter is issued without any prejudice to
Procuring Entity’s rights and remedies under the terms and conditions of the subject contract
and without any commitment or obligation.”
If at any time during the currency of the contract, the supplier encounters conditions
hindering timely delivery of goods, he shall promptly inform the concerned officer in writing.
He should mention its likely duration and make a request for extension of the schedule
accordingly. On receiving the supplier’s communication, the procuring entity shall examine
the proposal (refer to Annexure 18) and, on approval from the CA, may agree to extend the
delivery schedule, with or without LD and with or without the denial clause (as defined in
Para 9.7.8 below), for completion of the contractor’s contractual obligations, provided:
That a higher rate in the original tender was not accepted against other lower
quotations in consideration of the earlier delivery; and
ii) That there is no falling trend in prices for this item as evidenced from the fact that, in
the intervening period, neither orders have been placed at rates lower than this
contract nor any tender been opened where such rates have been received even
though the tender is not yet decided. In cases of certain raw material supplies, where
prices are linked to the PVC, extension may be granted even in case of a falling trend
in price indices, since the purchaser’s interests are protected by the price variation
mechanism. However, in such cases it should be ensured that extensions are done
with the denial clause.
When it is decided to extend the delivery period subject to recovery of LD for delay in
supplies, contractors must be given a warning to this effect in writing at the time of granting
extensions. It is not correct to grant extensions without any mention of the LD if it is
proposed to recover such charges eventually. It is also not correct to grant an extension of
the delivery period by merely stating that the extension is granted “without prejudice to the
rights of the purchaser under the terms and conditions of the contract” as this would mean
that all the options given in the conditions of the contract would be available to the purchaser
on expiry of the extended delivery period and would not amount to exercise of the option to
recover LD. To take care of complex legalities brought out above, extension of the delivery
period when granted should only be done in writing in the laid down format given in
Annexure 19.
i)

Organsations may put in place a graded authority structure whereby extension of time for
completion of contract, beyond a specified threshold value of contract, may be granted by
the next higher authority.

153

9.7.5

Delay in Supplies for which Supplier is not Responsible

Normally, in the following circumstances, the contractual delivery period needs to be re-fixed
to take care of the lost period, without imposing any penalty to the supplier:

i) Cases where the manufacture of stores is dependent on the approval of the advance
sample and delay occurs in approving the sample though submitted by the supplier in
time;
ii) Where extension in the delivery period is granted on account of some omission on
the part of the purchaser which affects the due performance of the contract by the
supplier; and
iii) Cases where the purchaser controls the entire production.
9.7.6 Performance Notice
A situation may arise where the supply/services has not been completed within the
stipulated period due to negligence/fault of the supplier; however, the supplier has not made
any request for extension of the delivery period but the contracted goods/services are still
required by the purchaser and the purchaser does not want to cancel the contract at that
stage. In such a case, a performance notice (also known as notice-cum-extension letter)
may be issued to the supplier by suitably extending the delivery date and by imposing LD
with denial clauses, and so on, along identical lines as in para 9.7.4 above. The supplier's
acceptance of the performance notice and further action thereof should also be processed in
the same manner as mentioned above. The text of the performance notice will be on similar
lines to the Annexure 19.
9.7.7

Force Majeure Clause

A Force Majeure (FM) means extraordinary events or circumstance beyond human control
such as an event described as an act of God (like a natural calamity) or events such as a
war, strike, riots, crimes (but not including negligence or wrong-doing, predictable/seasonal
rain and any other events specifically excluded in the clause). An FM clause in the contract
frees both parties from contractual liability or obligation when prevented by such events from
fulfilling their obligations under the contract. An FM clause does not excuse a party's nonperformance entirely, but only suspends it for the duration of the FM. The firm has to give
notice of FM as soon as it occurs and it cannot be claimed ex-post facto. There may be a FM
situation affecting the purchase organisation only. In such a situation, the purchase
organisation is to communicate with the supplier along similar lines as above for further
necessary action. If the performance in whole or in part or any obligation under this contract
is prevented or delayed by any reason of FM for a period exceeding 90 (ninety) days, either
party may at its option terminate the contract without any financial repercussion on either
side.
Notwithstanding the punitive provisions contained in the contract for delay or breach of
contract, the supplier would not be liable for imposition of any such sanction so long as the
delay and/or failure of the supplier in fulfilling its obligations under the contract is the result of
an event covered in the FM clause.
9.7.8 Denial Clause
Since delay in delivery is a default by the seller, the buyer should protect himself against
extra expenditure during the extended period by stipulating a denial clause (over and above
levy of LD) in the letter informing the supplier of extension of the delivery period. In the

154

denial clause, any increase in statutory duties and/or upward rise in prices due to the PVC
clause and/or any adverse fluctuation in foreign exchange are to be borne by the seller
during the extended delivery period, while the purchaser reserves his right to get any benefit
of a downward revisions in statutory duties, PVC and foreign exchange rate. Thus, PVC,
other variations and foreign exchange clauses operate only during the original delivery
period. The format of the denial clause is available in Annexure19.
9.7.9 Liquidated Damages
Compensation of loss on account of late delivery (actually incurred as well as notional)
where loss is pre-estimated and mutually agreed to is termed as LD. Law allows recovery of
pre-estimated loss provided such a term is included in the contract and there is no need to
establish actual loss due to late supply [MallaBaux Vs. UOI (1970)].
9.7.10 Quantum of LD
While granting extension of the delivery period, where the delivery of stores or any
instalment thereof is accepted after expiry of the original delivery period, the CA may recover
from the contractor, as agreed, the LD a sum equivalent to 0.5 (half) per cent of the prices of
any portion of stores delivered late, for each week or part thereof of delay. The total
damages shall not exceed 10 (ten) per cent of the value of delayed goods. The LD cannot
exceed the amount stipulated in the contract [NC Sanyal Vs. Calcutta Stock Exchange
(1971)].
In contracts governed by any type of variation (PVC, ERV or statutory variations), LDs (if a
percentage of the price) will be applicable on the price as varied by the operation of the
PVC. LDs accrue only in case of delayed supplies. Where or in so far as no supplies have
been made under a contract, upon cancellation, recovery of only the loss occasioned
thereby can be made, notwithstanding the fact that prior to the cancellation one or more
extensions of the delivery period with reservation of the right to LD are granted.
Government establishments/Departments, as distinct from PSUs, that execute contract work
should not be dealt with as ordinary contractors and not generally be penalised for late
delivery and claims for loss on risk-purchase should not be enforced against them. Serious
cases of defaults should, however, be brought to the notice of the HOD or the Government
Department concerned.
Relaxations allowed to Government establishments/Departments, as above, will not apply to
PSUs as a matter of course. Each case should be decided on merits and the decision to
waive the recovery of LDs or risk purchase expenditure should be taken on merit.
In the case of development/indigenisation contracts, LDs are not levied. However, the nature
of such contracts should be declared at the time of placing them.
In case of entire (non-severable) contracts, even where staggered deliveries have been
indicated, it may happen that supplies are not received according to the delivery schedule. In
such cases, keeping in mind the fact that the deliveries indicated under the contract are nonseverable, no question of LDs or enforcement of risk purchase would arise so long as there
has been no delay in the completion of supplies with reference to the total delivery period.
9.7.11 Waiver of LD
There should normally be no system of waiver of LDs for delayed supplies in supply
contracts and it may be strictly be an exception rather than a rule. For an extension of the

155

delivery date with waiver of LD, approval of the CA with consultation of associated Finance
may be taken and justifications recorded.
9.7.12 Handling Deliveries after the Expiry of Delivery Period
As per law, if stores are accepted after expiry of the delivery date of a particular instalment
without extension in delivery period having being given, duly reserving our rights to levy LD,
it amounts to voluntary abrogation of our legal rights under the contract to claim LDs or other
remedies.
If the contractor makes supplies locally after the expiry of delivery period, the supplies may
be provisionally retained under a franking clause reserving rights and the contractor may be
asked to obtain an extension of the delivery period from an authorised officer with or without
any LD/denial clause.
“Please note that materials have been supplied after the expiry of contracted delivery date
and its provisional retention does not acquiesce or condone the late delivery and does not
intend or amount to an extension of the delivery period or keeping the contract alive. You
may apply for an extension of delivery date from the procuring entity. The goods are being
retained without prejudice to the rights of the Government of India under the terms and
conditions of the contract.”
As regards supplies coming from outside contractors, if the contractor dispatches the stores
after expiry of the delivery period, the consignee should, after the receipt of the railway
receipt or lorry receipt or goods consignment note or airway bill, send an intimation to the
contractor stating that the action taken by him in dispatching the goods after expiry of
delivery date is at his own risk and responsibility, and that the consignee is not liable for any
demurrage, wharfage and deterioration of goods at the destination station and, in his own
interest, the contractor should get an extension of the delivery period from the purchasers. A
copy of the communication sent to the contractor should also be sent to the purchaser.
In case of imports, the contractor must not dispatch the consignment after expiry of the
delivery period without taking prior extension of the delivery period. In any case, the terms of
LC should be such that if there are dispatches beyond the delivery period, payment should
be denied without levy of full LD and without formal extension of the delivery period by the
purchaser.

9.8

Breach of Contract, Remedies and Termination

In case the contractor is unable to honour important stipulations of the contract, or gives
notice of his intention of not honouring or his inability to honour such a stipulation, a breach
of contract is said to have occurred. Mostly, such breaches occur in relation to the
performance of the contract in terms of inability to supply the required quantity or quality. It
could also be due to breach of ethical standards or any other stipulation that affects
Procuring Entity seriously.
The purchaser or its authorised representative is not to enter into correspondence after
expiry of the delivery date stipulated in the contract because such a correspondence will
keep the contract alive and would amount to abrogation of the purchaser’s right and
remedies for delays by the contractor. This situation will not allow the purchaser to cancel
the contract straight away without first serving a performance notice to the supplier.
However, even after expiry of the delivery period of the contract, the purchaser may obtain

156

information regarding past supplies, and so on, from the supplier, simultaneously making it
clear to the supplier that calling of such information is not intended to keep the contract valid
and it does not amount to waiving the breach and that it is without prejudice to the rights and
remedies available to the purchaser under the terms of the contract. A model communication
which may be issued by the purchaser to ascertain the supply position after expiry of the
delivery period is given at Annexure 20. As soon as a breach of contract is noticed, a show
cause notice should be issued to the contractor reserving the right to implement contractual
remedies. If there is an unsatisfactory resolution, remedial action may be taken immediately.
The CA may terminate a contract in the following cases.
9.8.1 Cancellation of Contract for Default
Without prejudice to any other remedy for breach of contract, such as removal from the list of
registered supplier, by written notice of default sent to the supplier, the contract may be
terminated in whole or in part:
i) If the supplier fails to deliver any or all of the stores within the time period(s) specified
in the contract, or any extension thereof granted; and
ii) If the supplier fails to perform any other obligation under the contract within the
period specified in the contract or any extension thereof granted;
iii) If the contract is terminated in whole or in part, recourse may be taken to any one or
more of the following actions:
a) Forfeiture of the performance security;
b) Upon such terms and in such manner as it deems appropriate, goods similar
to those undelivered may be procured and the supplier shall be liable for all
available actions against him in terms of the contract (popularly called risk
purchase); and
c) However, the supplier shall continue to fulfil the contract to the extent not
terminated.
Before cancelling the contract and taking further action, it may be desirable to obtain legal
advice.
9.8.2 Termination of Contract for Insolvency
If the supplier becomes bankrupt or becomes otherwise insolvent or undergoes liquidation or
loses substantially the technical or financial capability (based on which he was selected for
award of contract), at any time, the contract may be terminated, by giving a written notice to
the supplier, without compensation to the supplier, provided that such termination will not
prejudice or affect any right of action or remedy which has accrued or will accrue thereafter
to Procuring Entity.
9.8.3 Termination of Contract for Convenience
After placement of the contract, there may be an unforeseen situation compelling Procuring
Entity to cancel the contract. In such a case, a suitable notice has to be sent to the supplier
for cancellation of the contract, in whole or in part, for its (Procuring Entity’s) convenience,
inter alia, indicating the date with effect from which the termination will to become effective.
This is not Procuring Entity’s legal right– the contractor has to be persuaded to acquiesce.
Depending on the merits of the case, the supplier may have to be suitably compensated on
mutually agreed terms for terminating the contract. Suitable provisions to this effect should
be to be incorporated in the tender document as well as in the resultant contract.

157

9.9

Dispute Resolution

Normally, there should not be any scope for dispute between the purchaser and supplier
after entering into a mutually agreed valid contract. However, due to various unforeseen
reasons, problems may arise during the progress of the contract leading to a disagreement
between the purchaser and supplier. Therefore, the conditions governing the contract should
contain suitable provisions for settlement of such disputes or differences binding on both
parties. The mode of settlement of such disputes/differences should be through arbitration.
However, when a dispute/difference arises, both the purchaser and supplier should first try
to resolve it amicably by mutual discussion, mediation, and conciliation79. If the parties fail to
resolve the dispute within 21 (twenty-one) days, then, depending on the position of the case,
either the purchaser or supplier should give notice to the other party of its intention to
commence arbitration. When the contract is with a domestic supplier, the applicable
arbitration procedure shall be as per the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
[Amended 2015 80 and 2021 81 ]. While processing a case for dispute
resolution/litigation/arbitration, the procuring entity is to take legal advice, at appropriate
stages.
9.9.1 Arbitration Clause
If an amicable settlement is not forthcoming, recourse may be taken to the settlement of
disputes through arbitration as per the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. For this
purpose, when the contract is with a domestic supplier, a standard arbitration clause may be
included in the SBD indicating the arbitration procedure to be followed. The venue of
arbitration should be the place from where the contract has been issued.
Arbitration and dispute resolution
i)

ii)

iii)

During operation of the contracts, issues and disputes arising due to lack of clarity in the
contract become the root cause of litigation. Litigation has adverse implications on the
timelines and overall cost of the project. Before resorting to arbitration/litigation, the
parties may opt for mutual discussion, mediation, and Conciliation for the resolution of
disputes.
Arbitration /court awards should be critically should be critically reviewed. In cases where
there is a decision against government / public sector enterprise (PSE), the decision to
appeal should not be taken in a routine manner, but only when the case genuinely merits
going for the appeal and there are high chances of winning in the court/ higher court.
There is a perception that such appeals etc. are sometimes resorted to postpone the
problem and defer personal accountability. Casual appealing in arbitration / court cases
has resulted in payment of heavy damages / compensation / additional interest cost,
thereby causing more harm to the exchequer, in addition to tarnishing the image of the
Government.
The Organisation should monitor the success rate of appealing against arbitration
awards. There should be a clear delegation to empower officials to accept arbitration /
court orders. A special board / committee may be set up to review the case before an
appeal is filed against an order. Arbitration /court awards should not be routinely

appealed without due application of mind on all facts and circumstances including
realistic probability of success. The board / committee or other authority deciding on the
matter shall clarify that it has considered both legal merits and the practical chances of
success and after considering the cost of, and rising through, litigation / appeal / further
litigation as the case may be, it is satisfied that such litigation / appeal / further litigation
cost is likely to be financially beneficial compared to accepting the arbitration / court
award.
iv)
Statistics have shown that in cases where the arbitration award is challenged, a large
majority of cases are decided in favour of the contractor. In such cases, the amount
becomes payable with the interest, at a rate which is often far higher than the
government's cost of funds. This results in huge financial losses to the government.
Hence, in aggregate, it is in public interest to take the risk of paying a substantial part of
the award amount subject to the result of the litigation, even if in some rare cases of
insolvency etc. recovery of the amount in case of success may become difficult.
Instructions have been issued in this matter in the past, but have not been fully complied
with.
v)
The only circumstances in which such payment need not be made is where the
contractor declines, or is unable, to provide the requisite bank guarantee and/or fails to
open a escrow account as required. Persons responsible for not adhering to are liable to
be held personally accountable for the additional interest arising, in the event of the final
court order going against the procuring entity82.
9.9.2 Foreign Arbitration
The Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 has provisions for international commercial
arbitration, which shall be applicable if one of the parties has its central management and
control in any foreign country.
When the contract is with a foreign supplier, the supplier has the option to choose either the
Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or arbitration in accordance with the provisions
of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules.
The arbitration clause with foreign firms should be in the form of self-contained agreements.
This is true especially for large value contracts or those for costly plant and machinery. The
venue of arbitration should be in accordance with UNCITRAL or arbitration rules of India,
whereby it may be in India or in any neutral country.
9.9.3

Arbitration Awards

i) In cases where the Ministry/ Department has challenged an arbitral award and, as a
result, the amount of the arbitral award has not been paid, 75% of the arbitral award
(which may include interest up to date of the award) shall be paid by the Ministry/
Department to the contractor/ concessionaire against a Bank Guarantee (BG). The BG
shall only be for the said 75% of the arbitral award as above and not for the interest
which may become payable to the Ministry/ Department should the subsequent court
order require refund of the said amount.
ii) The payment may be made into a designated Escrow Account with the stipulation that

82

As notified under para 16.1 to 16.5 of OM No.F.1/1/2021-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated
29.10.2021

159

the proceeds will be used first, for payment of lenders' dues, second, for completion of
the project and then for completion of other projects of the same Ministry/ Department as
mutually agreed/ decided. Any balance remaining in the escrow account subsequent to
settlement of lenders' dues and completion of projects of the Ministry/ Department may
be allowed to be used by the contractor/ concessionaire with the prior approval of the
lead banker and the Ministry/ Department. If otherwise eligible and subject to contractual
provisions, retention money and other amounts withheld may also be released against
BG.]83

9.10 Closure of Contract
While making the final payment to the contractor and before releasing the PBG, it should be
ensured that there is nothing outstanding from the contractor, because it would be difficult to
retrieve such amounts after releasing the bank guarantee/final payment. Before the bank
guarantee is released a “no claim certificate” may be taken from the contractor as per the
format given in Annexure 21. At least in large contracts [above Rs. 25(Rupees twentyfive)lakh], it should be ensured that before the release of the bank guarantee (final payment,
if there is no bank guarantee), the following reconciliations should be done across
Departments involved in the execution of the contract:
9.10.1 Materials Reconciliation
The stores and/or the indenter should confirm that all materials ordered in the contract and
paid for have been received in good condition and there is no shortfall. Full reconciliation of
all raw material, part, assembly provided to the contractor should be done including
wastages and return of scrap/off-cuts.
9.10.2 Reconciliation with the User Department
Besides material reconciliation, the user Department should certify in writing that the
following activities (wherever applicable) have been completed by the contractor, to the
Department’s satisfaction, as per the contract:
i) Achievement of performance standards of material/equipment supplied;
ii) Installation and commissioning;
iii) Support service during the warranty period which has ended on ______;
iv) Training of operators/maintenance staff;
v) Return of all ID cards, gate passes, documents, drawings, protective gear, material,
equipment, facilities and assets loaned to contractor; and
vi) Support during annual maintenance contract (if it was part of the contract) which has
ended on ______.

9.10.3 Payment Reconciliation
The indenting/materials management Departments may reconcile payments made to the
contractor to ensure that there is no liability outstanding against the contractor on account of:
i) LD;
ii) Price reduction enforced on account of shortfall in performance of
material/equipment;

83
New rule 227A of GFR, 2017 notified vide OM No. F./1/9/2021-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 29.10.2021.

160

iii) Variations/deviations from the scope of the contract;
iv) Overpayments/duplicate payments, if any;
v) Services availed from Procuring Entity and vacation thereof such as accommodation,
electricity, water, security, transport, cranes and other machinery, and so on,
vi) Demurrage, insurance premiums or claims, customs duties, and so on;
vii) Material reconciliation;
viii) Price and exchange rate variations;
ix) Statutory duties paid on behalf of the contractor by Procuring Entity; and
x) Inspection charges or loss of material in testing.
On satisfactory reconciliation and against a “no claim certificate” from the contractor, the
bank guarantee may be released and its acknowledgement taken from the contractor.

On completion of all activities against a contract, the purchase file should be preserved for a
period of five years in the record room and then destroyed after expiry of the applicable
mandatory retention period with the approval of the CA. However, Procuring Entity, at its
discretion, may retain important records for future reference.

9.11 Goods Receiving
9.11.1 Transportation of Goods
Where critical equipment of high value is involved, suitable special instructions shall be
conveyed to the supplier about the mode of transport, loading, avoidance of transhipment
and, if necessary, provision of escorts. In case of chemicals, powdery materials, liquid
materials, and so on, parties may be advised on proper packaging to avoid spillage en route,
so as to avoid pollution problems and also to conform to the ISO 14001 standard. In case
transport is arranged by Procuring Entity, suitable instructions may be incorporated in the
transportation contract accordingly.
Wherever the items make a full truck load, the suppliers should be advised to dispatch such
items in a full truck direct to the consignee on a door delivery basis to the site. In such cases,
Procuring Entity shall advise the supplier to send a consignee copy of the lorry receipt to the
consignee along with the consignment and the consignment shall be booked to Procuring
Entity and not “self”. The supplier shall be specifically asked to dispatch the consignments to
the designated consignee. All dispatch documents, that is, railway/lorry receipt, goods
consignment note, airway bill, invoices, packing list, freight memos, test certificate, and so
on, shall be sent to the Associated/ integrated Finance which will arrange to make the
payment. If the payment is to be made through the bank, all original documents are to be
sent through the designated bank.
9.11.2 Distribution of Dispatch Documents for Clearance/Receipt of Goods
The supplier shall send all the relevant dispatch documents well in time to the purchaser to
enable the purchaser to clear or receive (as the case may be) the goods in terms of the
contract. Necessary instructions for this purpose are to be incorporated in the contract.
Within 24 (twenty-four) hours of dispatch, the supplier shall notify the purchaser or
consignee (others concerned), the complete details of dispatch and also supply the following
documents by registered post/ speed post/air mail/courier (or as instructed in the contract).
The supplier should submit five copies of his invoice. The invoices must be pre-stamped and
shall indicate the details of the lorry receipt or railway receipt number, as the case may be,
and also the details of the packing list and items dispatched. The invoice must also indicate
the purchase order number and date, unit rate and net total price; the packing list shall

161

include the total weight of the consignment and items dispatched. All documents are to be
duly signed by the supplier’s representative. Bank charges towards processing of the bills for
payment shall be as per terms and conditions of the purchase order.
9.11.3 Receipt of Consignment
At the time of the delivery at the stores, the storekeeper should receive the goods on a
“subject to inspection” basis and should issue the preliminary receipt after a preliminary
inspection as an acknowledgement of having received the claimed quantity (not the quality)
of consignment.

i) Preliminary Inspection on Receipt
On opening the packages (if applicable), the storekeeper should initiate preliminary
inspection of the goods received. This should include checks for any obvious
damage in transit and other physical or visual checks specific to the functional
characteristics of the product. The quantity of the goods received should also be
verified at this stage against the purchase order and the supplier’s invoice. When
goods are supplied in boxes, bundles or coils as in the case of tools, rope, canvas,
barbed wire, and so on, each of which is required to contain a specified quantity, a
reasonable number of such packages should be opened up and checked for quantity
per package. The quantity received should also be mentioned in the preliminary
receipt to be given to the supplier. Any discrepancies in packages or quantity should
be mentioned therein.
ii)

Detailed Inspection on Receipt
Before accepting the ordered goods, the storekeeper must ensure that the goods
have been manufactured as per the required specifications and are capable of
performing the functions as specified in the contract. To achieve this, the tender
document and the subsequent contract should include references to standards or
specifications that specify the details of inspection and tests to be carried out and
stages and manner of carrying out these tests.

The required inspections and tests should be carried out by technically qualified and
competent personnel. If the procurement agency does not have such qualified personnel, it
may engage competent professionals from other Departments or even outside agencies.

9.12 Quality Assurance and Inspection
In the context of procurement of goods, the Quality Assurance (QA) process is needed to
provide adequate confidence that a procured product will satisfy the laid down standards of
quality and serve the purpose for which it is being procured. QA consists of three
components:
i) Defining quality standards;
ii) Planning assurance of quality; and
iii) Measurement of quality.
The description and TS define the quality standards expected from the product.

Planning for QA is done by way of specifying the qualifications criteria for the suppliers to
ensure that they do have the technical, infrastructure and financial capabilities to meet the
required quality standards. Specifications also lay down quality control requirements to
indicate parameters, target values, tolerances and method of measurement of various

162

parameters that constitute the standards of quality. This also involves laying down the type
of inspection, agency for inspection.
Measurement of quality is done though a scheme of inspections at the contract management
stage and laying down the actual process of inspection.
9.12.1 Inspections – Measuring Quality Standards
The stages and modes of inspection may vary depending on the nature of the goods, total
value of the contract, location of the supplier, location of the user, and so on. Depending on
the nature of goods being procured, usually, the following types of inspection may be
adopted:
9.12.2 Types of Inspection

i) Pre-dispatch Inspection
A pre-dispatch inspection may be conducted either during various stages of the
production process (which is known as stage inspection) or on production of the
finished products, but before dispatch of the goods from the supplier’s premises.
Stage inspection may be used for highly technical goods whose quality of the
manufacturing process is likely to have considerable effect on the final quality and
durability of the goods. Even after pre-dispatch inspections, these materials should
be inspected again on receipt, as a matter of abundant precaution.
Inspection of the materials before dispatch shall be carried out by the inspection
agency nominated in the contract or by its representative at the premises of the
supplier in accordance with the inspection procedure laid down and incorporated in
the purchase order.
The testing charges for samples should be borne by the supplier and this should be
made clear at the enquiry stage itself to avoid claims at a later date/or effect on his
position in comparative statement of offers. Any special testing involving financial
implications shall be settled prior to placement of the order and such cost should
form part of the evaluation.
In case of offshore supplies, the inspection clause shall be incorporated in the
purchase order wherever required:
a) Procuring Entity may depute its representative or a third party inspection
agency to the supplier’s manufacturing premises to carry out/witness
inspection and testing, performance testing at its discretion;
b) Alternatively, Procuring Entity shall retain an option to waive the above and
accept the material based on the supplier’s internal test report, guarantee and
fitment certificate. In this regard, the written approval of the HOD of the
Indenting Department should be obtained recording the reasons for it; and
c) Whenever the inspection is carried out at the supplier’s manufacturing
premises, an inspection on receipt of goods at Procuring Entity shall also be
carried out by an officer of the Indenting Department or a third party
inspection agency, as the case may be, on receipt of the goods.
d) It has been brought to the notice of Department of Expenditure that in the
contracts signed with suppliers by some of the Ministries/ Departments have
clauses of pre-inspection at the firm’s premises, where there is a provision

163

that the suppliers or the vendors will pay for the travel, stay, hospitality and
other expenses of the Inspecting officials. This is not in keeping with need to
safeguard the independence of the inspecting teams. Such provisions win
contracts need to be discouraged, so that Inspections are not compromised.
Necessary steps may be taken to strictly avoid such provisions in the
contracts with suppliers/ vendors84.
ii)

Inspection of Goods on Receipt at Consignee/User’s Site
Post-delivery inspection is carried out on receipt of goods before accepting them.
This should be typically done for goods that are available off-the-shelf and are BIS
marked. All final goods that may be directly consumed or utilised on delivery
(excluding machinery installations, and so on) and for which detailed inspection of
the manufacturing process is not required and only a physical inspection regarding
their physical characteristics is required, may be inspected using this method. On
receipt of goods at stores, the storekeeper should immediately notify the officer
nominated for inspection, requesting to schedule an inspection. The inspecting officer
should then fix a date for inspection.
The consignee has the right to reject the goods on receipt during the final inspection
on delivery even though the goods have already been inspected and cleared at the
pre-dispatch stage by Procuring Entity’s inspector. However, such rejection should
be strictly within the contractual terms and conditions and no new condition should be
adopted while rejecting the goods during final inspection.
Goods accepted by the purchaser at the initial and final inspections, in terms of the
contract, shall in no way dilute the purchaser's right to reject them later, if found
deficient in terms of the warranty clause of the contract.
In case of rejection of goods at this stage, the material rejection advice/rejection
memo should be issued. In case of pre-inspected goods, a joint inspection of the
rejected lot of goods should be held with the pre-inspecting agency and firm. In case
of failure of the firm to associate with a joint inspection, it should be held with the preinspecting agency.
In case of rejection of the pre-inspected supply of goods at the consignee end, the
material rejection advice/rejection memo should be sent to all concerned, which is,
the firm, purchaser, pre-inspecting agency, paying authority, associate bill paying
authority, and so on, without fail. The concerned paying authority as per the contract
and associate bill paying authority should note the rejection advice details in its
recovery register for effecting recovery of payments made, as the case may be. In
case of replacement supply against the rejected lot of goods, the process should
remain exactly the same in terms of sequence of pre-inspection/inspection as laid
down in the contract, prior to acceptance by the consignee. In case of acceptance of
the replacement supply/rejected supply after rectification, the earlier issued material
rejection advice/ rejection memo should be withdrawn under advice to all concerned.

iii)

84

Manufacturer’s Quality Self-certification

Notified vide OM No.F.11/13/2017-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 24.10.2017

164

Reputed manufacturers could be relied upon with respect to certain goods for quality
products. These may not be subjected to physical inspection and the materials may
be accepted under the firm’s quality self-certification. The physical inspection clause
stipulating the inspection authority and inspecting officer in such cases should not be
included in the contracts entered into. Waiver of pre-dispatch inspection and
acceptance of materials under the firm’s quality self-certification may be considered
where:
a) The user Departments indicate, in their indent, that physical inspection is not
necessary and that the materials can be accepted on the firm’s quality selfcertification;
b) The user Department requests for a waiver of inspection to meet urgent requirement
and where the firm is agreeable to 100 (hundred) per cent payment against the
consignee’s receipt and acceptance. In such cases, the user Departments
themselves should be responsible for ensuring the quality of goods supplied;
c) In case of goods to be imported from abroad, pre-dispatch inspection of goods at the
supplier's premises involves considerable expenditure to the purchaser. In such a
situation, the purchaser may substitute pre-dispatch inspection by its own inspector
with manufacturer's in-house inspection report and warranty. However, before
adopting this procedure, the nature and cost of the goods ordered, the reputation of
the supplier, and so on, should also be kept in view and appropriate decision taken.
For checking the reputation and background of the supplier, the purchase
organisation may also request the Indian embassy located in that country for a report
on the technical and financial competence of the firm. Further, trustworthy
publications such as Thomas Register, Dun and Brad Street Register, and so on, are
also available in the USA and Europe which provide authentic technical and financial
data and details of the manufacturing companies located in those countries. Such
publications may also be relied upon for this purpose; and
d) However, the right of waiver of inspection may be reserved only for specific
requirements. Justification for the waiver should be recorded. Also, a suitable clause
may be incorporated in the conditions of contract.
iv)

Inspection on Installation and Commissioning
This method is adopted to check the performance and output of equipment or
machinery after it is commissioned and operational at site.

9.12.3 Types of Inspection Agencies
Normally, inspection modalities or agencies for inspections specified in the contract should
not be changed. In rare cases, when this becomes inescapable, it should be done with the
approval of the CA, justifying the rare circumstances, ensuring that no undue benefit accrues
to the contractor.

i) Internal Inspection Authorities
Wherever there is technical expertise available in-house, an internal officer of the
Indenting Department is nominated for inspection. The consignee should be the final
authority for acceptance of goods.

ii) External Inspecting Authorities
165

In case Procuring Entity does not have technical expertise or for other relevant
reasons, inspection may also be entrusted to a third-party inspection authority. The
procuring entity, however, retains the right to reject the consignment, even if it is
cleared by third party inspection authorities.
Sometimes, it becomes necessary to conduct a type test, acceptance test or special
test at external laboratories, when facilities for these tests are not available in-house
with the supplier or carrying out of confirmatory tests is considered desirable before
accepting the goods. The Procuring Entity should draw up a list of approved
laboratories for this purpose, to which the samples drawn from the lots offered by the
supplier can be sent for tests. The list should also contain approved laboratories,
which can be used as referral/appellate laboratories for retest, when samples tested
at one laboratory are decided to be re-tested. The following guidelines should apply
to such cases:
a) External testing may invariably be done by national accredited or reliable
laboratories, preference being given to National Test House (NTH). For
testing the samples drawn from the lots offered by the supplier, an inspection
agent qualified to conduct random sampling in accordance with Quality
Assurance requirements should do the selection of samples;
b) Test reports must contain the values obtained in the tests besides fail/pass
results. The laboratory must preserve the sample and test records for a
period of three years;
c) The Department should lay down a liability statement for costs expended on
tests, dispatch of samples, transportation costs, test charges, and so on., in
respect of samples tested at outside laboratories as may be applicable; and
d) In cases where the samples are to be tested at the supplier’s cost because of
non-availability of his own testing arrangements, the responsibility of
depositing the testing fees would rest with the supplier.
e) Normally unless otherwise intended in the contract, charges of routine testing
prior to dispatch of materials are to be borne by the supplier and charges of
testing of materials after receipt by consignee are to be borne by the
procuring agency. Contract should be clear about responsibility of cost of
materials expended in tests and charges of special tests e.g. type test or tests
at external labs. Even where procuring entity is responsible for testing
charges, if the material fails in the test, the charges would become the
responsibility of the seller.

iii) Joint Inspection on Complaint
In case a written complaint is received from the supplier disputing the rejection of goods
by the Procuring Entity’s inspecting officer, it should be jointly investigated by a team
consisting of an authorised representative of the Procuring Entity, a senior representative
of the inspecting agency who is conversant with the goods and an authorised
representative of the supplier.
9.12.4 Issue of Inspection Report

166

After satisfactory inspection and tests, the acceptable goods shall be stamped, labelled,
marked or sealed, in such a way as to make subsequent identification and tally with the
inspection report of accepted lots easy for the consignee/user. The following guidelines
should be used for inspection reports to be issued:

i) Each inspecting officer shall be supplied with acceptance stamps, lead seals, pliers,
rubber stamps, stencils, labels, stickers, holograms, and so on, according to
requirements, for sealing and marking the inspected goods in terms of the contract.
He will be responsible for safekeeping of these articles and shall ensure that they are
not misused by unauthorised persons. Unserviceable seals, pliers, stamps, stickers,
holograms, and so on, shall be returned to the concerned issuing official. The
procuring entity shall lay down detailed guidelines covering all these aspects. For
reasons of security and to avoid irregular or incorrect issue, inspection notebooks
should be machine numbered and, wherever possible, different coloured copies
marked for each user. An account of the inspection notes issued with serial numberwise details shall be maintained in an appropriate register. Procuring Entity should
also develop a fool proof system to avoid any fraudulent and unauthorised use of the
inspection notes;

ii) There should not be any initial provisional acceptance at a lower level. A time limit
shall be fixed for the issue of inspection documents. The inspection note shall also
indicate the validity period, by which period the supplier must dispatch the accepted
goods to the consignee in terms of the contract. The number of copies of the
inspection notes and their distribution for different types of inspections will be as
prescribed by the procuring entity/indenter Department;

iii) Inspection reports should be prepared detailing the inspection done, samples
examined, requirements as per the relevant specification/contract and the
observations jointly with the representative of the firm. Each inspection note copy
issued should invariably bear the individual’s name, stamp along with his designation
and code number of the officer authorised to sign and issue inspection documents.
Facsimiles of the inspection stamps and their position should be put on the inspected
material to help identify the inspected goods at the consignee's end. Inspection note
copies meant for payments should be attested with full signature in ink by the
inspecting officer. The Accounts Department will make payments only against copies
so attested, not against any other copy. Corrections, if any, on the inspection note
should be duly authenticated by the officer issuing it. Similarly, each continuation
sheet, if attached to the inspection note, should be signed by the inspecting officer at
the relevant places and any correction duly authenticated;

iv) Departmental instructions should invariably prescribe that paying authorities will keep
a record of specimen signatures of authorised inspecting authorities for verification
with the signature in the inspection note while authorising payment;

v) A separate inspection report must be prepared for each consignment. In the case of
large consignments, the issue of the inspection report may not be held up until the
inspection of the full consignment is completed. These must be issued for lots
inspected every day or every two days. If the contract is in terms of ‘sets’ or ‘number’
and materials are such that they comprise a number of components or accessories,
the inspection report should be issued only when all parts, components and

167

accessories forming a set are inspected and accepted. When plant and equipment
are ordered with spares, the inspection report for spares should not be issued before
acceptance of the main equipment. In the case of contracts for imported materials
that involve initial inspection in the country of origin and final inspection in India, the
final inspection note should be issued giving reference of the certificate issued
abroad;

vi) In respect of materials which have been rejected by the inspecting officer, the
rejection inspection report should be issued immediately following the completion of
inspection. In case of total rejections, no copies meant for payments or the accounts
office should be issued. All the reasons for rejection and deviations against the
governing specifications, drawings or other particulars should invariably be noted in
detail in the “remarks” column of the rejection inspection note. The rejected material
should be given a yellow paint mark to avoid it being submitted again for inspection
or supplied to other customers. Such copies should be cancelled across by the
inspecting officer with his signature and retained in the inspection file along with the
office copy of the rejection inspection note; and

vii) No ‘certified true copy’ of the lost original payment copies should be issued until a
‘non-payment certificate’ has been received from the accounts officer concerned or
stating that payment has not been made and should not be made against the original
inspection report even if received subsequently. This copy must be endorsed as
“certified copy”. This endorsement should be attested in full in indelible ink by the
officer proving a cross reference to the accounts officer’s non-payment certificate
with the name stamp with the designation and code number of the officer issuing the
duplicate copy.
9.12.6 Material put up for Inspection towards the End of Delivery
As far as possible, the inspection should be commenced and finished and the inspection
report issued during the validity period of the contract. In cases where the supplier offers
materials for inspection during the last few days of the contract delivery period or even on
the last day of the contract delivery period, efforts should be made by the inspecting officer
to commence the inspection before the expiry of the delivery period.
In cases where it is not possible to commence or conclude the inspection before the expiry
of the delivery period, the inspecting officer should, immediately, on receipt of the intimation
or request for inspection of the materials, bring this to the notice of the supplier orally as well
as in writing. He must mention that the materials have been submitted for inspection at a
very late stage and that it is not possible to commence/conclude the inspection before the
expiry of the delivery period.
The supplier should also be informed that the goods offered for inspection should, however,
be inspected until the completion of the inspection which can be after the expiry of the
delivery period and that such an inspection continuing after the expiry of the delivery period
is neither intended nor to be construed as condoning the delay or keeping the contract alive.
In such cases, the inspection note, whether accepting or rejecting the goods, should be duly
franked as per the franking clause given below:
9.12.7 Franking Clause on Acceptance and Rejection

168

“The issue of this inspection/rejection report does not acquiesce or condone the late delivery
and does not intend or amount to an extension of the delivery period or keeping the contract
alive. The goods are being passed/ rejected without prejudice to the rights of the
Government of India under the terms and conditions of the contract.”
This clause may also be incorporated in conditions of the contract.
9.12.8 Approval of Acceptable Deviations
Under no circumstances will the inspecting officer have the authority to modify the governing
specifications, approved drawings or samples during inspection without reference to the CA
that approved the tender. For all cases of acceptance with deviation, the nature of deviation
along with a justification for acceptance against such deviation should be duly documented.
The CA that approved the tender should have the final decision on deviations.
Deviations from the contract specifications or requirements not affecting price, quality,
performance and other terms of the contract may be allowed at the level of the CA in
consultation with the user Department on merits or nature of deviations.
In all other cases, the goods should be rejected giving all reasons by issuing a rejection
inspection report. Rejections should not be made in a piecemeal manner.

9.13 Storage and Issue of Inspected Goods
After satisfactory inspection and tests, the accepted materials should be stamped, labelled,
marked, or sealed and stored in a systematic manner. This is to facilitate easy retrieval at a
later stage. As all goods needed or procured cannot be consumed at one point of time,
storage is an inevitable process. The storage system forms the key component of any
materials management system. It should be ensured that the goods are stored in such
conditions that they are protected against unauthorised removal and deterioration.

9.14 Accounting and Payment of Received Materials
9.14.1 Goods Receipt and Inspection Report
If the received material successfully passes the quantity and quality checks, accounting of
material received shall be on the basis of the Goods Receipt and Inspection Report (GRIR)
(Annexure 22) prepared after inspection and acceptance of the material which will be signed
by the concerned officers. This includes cases where payment is made to the supplier on
proof of dispatch, for which inspection at the suppliers’ premises is conducted by an
authorised officer of Procuring Entity prior to dispatch by suppliers. This excludes cases of
imported materials where accounting will be done on completion of certain further formalities
as per regulations and practices. While preliminary receipt is only an acknowledgement of
quantity received, GRIR is an acknowledgement of receipt of the correct quantity as well as
quality of goods. GRIR is a voucher which forms the basis for the supplier to claim payment
as per the contract. It also is a voucher for accountal of the received material in the inventory
accounts. Along with the GRIR, material is handed over to the warehouse where it is to be
stored.
In case the received material fails to pass quantity and quality checks, a rejection GRIR is
issued, noting the reasons for rejection. If feasible, a yellow paint mark should be put on the
rejected material to prevent its resubmission by the supplier. The associated Finance/ FA
should be asked to recover any advance payment or freight charges paid for the rejected
quantity. The rejection GRIR contains instructions for the supplier to take back the rejected
goods within a stipulated number of days (usually 21). Such removal should be permitted

169

only after the advance payment/freight paid is recovered. Lots that are under inspection,
accepted, or rejected should be properly tagged, segregated and identified.
9.14.2 Passing of Supplier’s Bills
After the GRIR is issued, the invoice is received from the supplier, supported by relevant
documents evidencing award of purchase orders/contracts and receipt of materials/services.
Based on contractual terms where payments are made based on proof of dispatch against a
purchase order, bills shall be passed and accounted based on the GRIR of approved
materials. The invoice submitted by the supplier will be verified and signed by the indenting
officer, and pay order form (Annexure 23) or any other relevant forms will be prepared by the
procuring entity and signed by an officer authorised to sign pay-orders. All correspondence
with the supplier will be handled by procuring entity Department.
The documents, which are needed from the supplier for release of payment, are to be clearly
specified in the contract. The paying authority is also to verify the documents received from
the supplier with corresponding stipulations made in the contract before releasing the
payment.
While claiming the payment, the supplier must also certify on the bill that the payment being
claimed is strictly in terms of the contract and all the obligations on his part for claiming this
payment have been fulfilled as required under the contract. There should also be a suitable
provision for verification of the authenticity of the person signing the invoice, and so on, to
claim the payment.
In case of part supply, the payment will be released by deducting 10 (ten)per cent of the bill
value which will be released once the entire supply is made. Deduction of applicable taxes at
source from payments to suppliers will be done as per the existing law in force during the
currency of the contract.
9.15 Contract Management - Risks and Mitigations
Risk
Mitigation
Advance payments: This is an area of risk Any mobilisation or other advance payments
in public procurement with undue and should be interest bearing and should be
unintended benefits to the contractor, which only for justifiable cases. Terms of such
vitiates the original selection criteria.
advances should be expressly stated in the
NIT/bid documents. The advance payment
may be released in not less than two stages
depending upon the progress of the contract.
Advance should be progressively adjusted
against bills cleared for payment. Interest
should be charged on delayed recoveries
irrespective of the reason stated.

Contract changes and renegotiations: This
is also a risk area, where the procuring entity
may not get what it contracted and paid for or
may pay for what it has not received. On the
other hand, the contractor may not get timely
or proper amendments due to changes
asked by the procuring entities.

Contract modifications and renegotiations
should not substantially alter the nature of
the contract. It should not vitiate the basis of
the selection of the contractor. It should not
give undue or unintended benefits to the

Chapter 10: Disposal of Scrap Goods
10.1

Scrap for Disposal

There accumulates, in every organisation, a large quantity of material which is neither usable
for the purpose for which it was originally procured nor of any other operational value. Such
material is generally called "scrap" and should be distinguished from other stores and
component parts which can be utilised after repair or renovation. Occasionally, scrap may
consist of second-hand or in excellent repair even new material which is surplus to the need
of the organisation or its sister organisations and may command a fair price in the market not
normally associated with scrap.

10.2

Classification and Categorisation

It is very important to categorise the scrapped items under different trade groups based on
the use to which the scrap purchaser can put it for commercial use, for example, melting, rerolling, burning, recycling, and so on. Properly grouped and sorted scrap is likely to attract
better value and help in keeping historical data of prices and facilitates fixing of reserve
prices.

10.3 Survey of Materials for Classifying as Scrap for Disposal
10.3.1 Competent Authority to declare and dispose off Scrap Material may be laid down in
the SoPP, based on the ‘Book Value’ or 5% (five percent) of the Original/ Market Value of
new goods, if Book value is either not available or has become negligible. Before any item
of stores can be sold as 'scrap', it should be declared as such by the Survey Committee
(SC) appointed by the Head of Office and the sanction of the CA obtained for such a sale.
The CA may relax this need for survey by SC, as a standing order, in the case of a list of
known items of scrap like Newspapers, containers etc. of small value (Rs. 5,000 – Rupees
Five Thousand). Lots of small value may also not require to be condemned by SC, on which
the Head of Office may be given powers to declare such materials as scrap without survey
committee. However, this dispensation is subject to furnishing of a certificate by the
concerned Departmental officer as laid down in the SoPP that the items being offered have
been inspected by him personally and found unserviceable and unfit for any further use.

10.3.2 Survey of Scrap: Generally, items may be identified as scrap in any of the following
cases:

i)

Whether the item has completed its expected useful life or not, factors such as
norms for maintenance cost; norms for utilisation of such equipment; usability in the
organisation or any other office must also to be considered before deciding on
scrapping the equipment; and
ii) The item has a limited shelf life, exists in surplus quantities and there is likely to be
no future use of the item during the remaining period of its useful life.
iii) The reasons for declaring the item surplus or obsolete or unserviceable should be
recorded by the SC. A standard format for SC’s recommendations for disposal of
goods is provided in Annexure 24.
iv) SC may seek the approval of the CA with the concurrence of the Associated/
integrated Finance.

172

10.4

Modes of Disposal

The mode of disposal may be determined by the CA, keeping in view the necessity to avoid
accumulation of such goods, consequent blockage of space and also deterioration in value
of goods to be disposed of. The usual modes of disposal of scrap are:

i) Small value scrap such as waste paper or industrial sweepings, and so on, up to a
value of Rs. 5,000 (Rupees Five thousand) in each case may be sold directly to the
local scrap dealers on a summary quotation basis; and

ii) Scrap upto Rupees two Lakh may be sold on a Limited Tender basis to locally known
Scrap Dealers of relevant category.

iii) Sale through the e-auction portal, or a tender for disposal or traditional public auction
may be resorted to for scrap value above Rupees two lakh. E-Auction should be the
preferred mode for such disposals, using the e-Auction platforms of NIC, MSTC,
Indian Railways or any other appropriate portal;

iv) Certain useable machinery/ spare may still be useable by other Ministries/
Departments/ PSUs; these should be disposed at book value plus 20 (twenty) per
cent (7.5 (seven and a half) per cent freight +12.5 (twelve and a half) per cent
handling charges) directly to the concerned organisation.

v) Sales by Submission of Tenders: Disposal may also be done by submitting bids in
response to public invitations for tenders for supplying materials, whether such
invitations are issued by Government Departments, PSUs or by private bodies. This
method of sale is particularly suitable where it is proposed to dispose of its
'overstocks' and surplus stores' which are in fit to use condition.

vi) Scrap which is a security or safety risk (stamps, negotiable instruments, money value
documents, security press items) may be destroyed suitably in an eco-friendly
manner in accordance with guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or
State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) in the presence of a committee after obtaining
CA’s approval. The committee should issue a certificate of having destroyed these.
Video recording may also be done of such disposal.

vii) Sale of hazardous waste items would be governed by the following procedures in
addition to guidelines/notifications issued by the Central Pollution Control Board
(CPCB)/Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) from time to time:
a) Sale of old batteries/lead acid batteries will be governed by the Batteries
(Management & Handling) Rules, 2001 or as amended from time to time;
b) Sale of other categories of hazardous waste items will be governed by the
Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement)
Rules, 2016or as amended from time to time;
c) Sale of e-waste shall be governed by E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016or
as amended from time to time;
d)

Bidders must submit a notarized copy of the valid registration certificates
issued by the State (or Union Territory) Pollution Control Board (SPCB) and
produce it at the time of taking delivery of the materials, failing which their bid
will be liable for rejection. In case of lead acid batteries, used/waste oils and
nonferrous metal wastes, in addition to submitting necessary valid registration

173

from the SPCB, the bidder must also submit a notarized copy of the valid
registration certificate from CPCB (or MoEF); and
e) In case of a sale involving inter-state movement of goods, the buyer shall also
submit an NOC from the concerned SPCB, with whom the buyer is registered,
to the seller before taking delivery, failing which the buyer will be responsible
for the consequences and the seller shall take further decision as may be
deemed fit.

10.5

Preparation for Disposal

10.5.1 Scrap recommended for disposal should be segregated from other materials into an
identifiable lot. It should be marked as such with a board, indicating the lot number and brief
description. Valuable scrap such as non-ferrous metals should be secured in lockable
rooms.

10.5.2 Determining Reserve Price
In any mode of disposal, material should not be sold at rates per lot but bids should be
registered by rate per unit (number, length or weight) so that a complete check on the
quantity delivered can be exercised, at any time. The Head of Office holding the stock may
determine the reserve price with the concurrence of the Associated/ integrated Finance and
approval of CA. In case of large value disposals a Reserve Price Committee may be
appointed to recommend the reserve price. The use of external costing experts, price
databases, price indices and data sharing may be done in the same manner as detailed in
Chapter 2, para 2.1.1 (f) relating to the reasonableness for procurement prices. Large
newspapers and economic dailies have dedicated sections dealing with rates in the scrap
market. The reserve price should be recorded on a page numbered register in advance of
the date of disposal. This register should be sealed immediately after the reserve prices of
all lots are recorded in the register, and kept in safe custody. The sealed register should be
opened just before the e-auction creation/tender opening. Some methods for determining
reserve prices are:

i) Book value with depreciation. In case the Book value is not available or has become
insignificant, the reserve price may be based on 5% of the Original or Market cost of
the new item;

ii) Last sale price moderated by quantity, quality, location, market condition, price trend
of various metals, and so on;

iii) Prevailing market price ascertained through a market survey; and
iv) Costing analysis based on costs of various elements of the item (discounted for
melting losses) labour charges and transportation cost, etc.

v) In cases where the reserve price cannot be fixed as per the laid down procedure an
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)-approved valuer may be
engaged for valuation of such material and the Reserve Price Committee will take
into account the valuation given by the valuer while recommending the reserve price.

10.6 Conditions of Disposal Applicable to all Modes of Disposal
10.6.1 ‘As-Is-Where-Is’ basis
Notwithstanding anything contained in the e-auction or advertisement issued on the
description and particulars of material for sale, the sale is on ‘as-is-where-is’ basis only and

174

the principle of caveat emptor (let the buyer be aware) will apply. As is where is means that
the description/quality/quantity indicated are approximate and the seller does not give any
assurance or guarantee that the material will strictly adhere to the advertisement or eauction. All items shall be taken delivery of from the site by the successful bidders, with its
faults and errors in description, if any. Neither can the sale be invalidated nor the bidder
make any claim/compensation, whatsoever, on account of any defect in description or
deficiency in the quantity and quality. No plea of misunderstanding or ignorance of
conditions put forth subsequent to a confirmation of sale shall be accepted.

10.6.2 Inspection by Bidders
In view of the ‘as-is-where-is’ condition, bidders are advised to quote rates only after
inspection of items at the site. The bidder or his authorised representative may inspect the
materials as per the inspection schedule mentioned in the auction details, between 11 am to
4 pm (excluding lunch hours) on any working day at the location specified against each lot
with the prior permission from the contact person, as given in the auction details. The
detailed description of all lots, including the list of spare parts, if any, is available at the site.

10.6.3 Right to Reject all Bids
The seller reserves the right to accept/reject and cancel any bid, amend the quantity under
any lot or withdraw any lot at any stage before or after acceptance of bid/issue of
acceptance letter/sale order/delivery order/deposit of the full sale value by the bidder,
without assigning any reason thereof and the value of such material, if paid for, shall be
refundable. The seller shall not be responsible for damage/loss to bidders on account of
such withdrawal at any stage from the sale.

10.6.4 Excise Duty and Taxes
Any statutory variations in the rate of taxes/duties are to be borne by the purchaser.
VAT/excise duty rates indicated in the e-auction catalogue or Tender advertisement are only
indicative and the actual VAT rates as applicable on the date shall be payable by the
successful bidders directly to the seller at the time of taking delivery of materials. Form ‘C’
will be accepted. In order to avoid the imposition of penalty, the amount deposited by the
successful bidder towards taxes and duties will be immediately deposited with the concerned
tax authorities without waiting for the actual delivery.

10.7

Disposal through Tender

Disposal through tender could take place through the e-procurement portal or normal
tendering. In the bidding documents, General Conditions of Sale (GCS, in place of GCC in
procurement tenders)may be laid out.
The broad steps to be adopted for this purpose are:
i) Preparation of bidding documents;
ii) Invitation of tender for the surplus goods to be sold;
iii) Opening of bids;
iv) Analysis and evaluation of bids received;
v) Selection of the highest responsive bidder;
vi) Collection of sale value from the selected bidder;
vii) Issue of sale release order to the selected bidder;

175

viii)Release of the sold surplus goods to the selected bidder; and
ix) Return of bid security to the unsuccessful bidders.
x) Any special conditions of contract for each lot may also be given. Important aspects
to be kept in view while disposing the goods through an advertised tender are:
a) The basic principle for sale of such goods through an advertised tender is
ensuring transparency, competition, fairness and elimination of discretion.
Wide publicity should be ensured of the sale plan and the goods to be sold;
b) All required terms and conditions of sale are to be incorporated in the bidding
document comprehensively in plain and simple language. The applicability of
taxes, as relevant, should be clearly stated in the document. The bidding
document should also indicate the location and present condition of the goods
to be sold so that the bidders can inspect the goods before bidding;
c) Bidders should be asked to furnish bid security (EMD) along with their bids.
The amount of bid security should ordinarily be five per cent of the assessed
or reserved price of the goods. The exact bid security amount should be
indicated in the bidding document. The EMD shall be forfeited if the tenderer
unilaterally withdraws, amends, impairs or derogates from his offer in any
respect within the period of validity of his offer;
d) Late bids, that is, bids received after the specified date and time of receipt
should not to be considered;
e) The bid of the highest acceptable responsive bidder should normally be
accepted and an acceptance/sale order be issued. However, if the price
offered by that bidder is not acceptable, a negotiation may be held only with
that bidder;
f) In case the selected bidder does not show interest in depositing the balance
sale value or in lifting the goods, the bid security should be forfeited and other
actions initiated including resale of the goods in question at the risk and cost
of the defaulter;
g) In case the total quantity to be disposed cannot be taken up by the highest
acceptable bidder, the remaining quantity may be offered to the next higher
bidder(s) at the price offered by the highest acceptable bidder. The minimum
quantity to be accepted shall be indicated in the tender;
h) If the tenderer’s offer is not accepted, the tenderer’s EMD shall be refunded to
him. No interest shall be payable on such refunds. The EMD deposited by the
successful tenderer shall remain with the disposing Department till payment
of the SD money has been made. It may be adjusted as part of the total SD
money at the discretion of disposing Department;
i) The offer should be examined by the competent level of Tender Committee
as per SoPP and TC recommendations should be accepted by the
Competent Authority as per the laid down SoPP;
j) The acceptance letter/sale order would be issued to the successful bidder(s)
notifying the amounts and schedule of submission of SD and Balance Sale
Value (BSV);
k) Successful tenderers, herein after referred to as purchasers, shall have to
submit a SD @ 25 (twenty-five) per cent of the total sale value of the contract
within seven calendar days of the issue of the acceptance letter/sale order
(excluding the date of issue). The SD shall be deposited in the form of bank

176

draft/pay order, drawn on any of the commercial bank in favour of officer
concerned as mentioned in the NIT;
l) BSV: The successful bidder in an e-auction or tender sale may be allowed 15
(fifteen) calendar days (including the date of acceptance letter/sale order) for
payment of BSV. The Head of Office (or the Officer delegated by an order as
per SoPP) after taking into consideration the prevailing market rates and
trends, may grant an extension of time for the payment of BSV with late
payment charges @ one per cent per week or part thereof up to two weeks
only and, thereafter, the SD will stand forfeited without notice. Extensions
should not be granted as a matter of routine. The date of submission of the
demand draft in the cash office is the date of payment for all purposes. No
interest will be paid to the purchaser for the amounts paid or deposited and
subsequently found refundable to the purchaser under any of the conditions
of the contract; and;
m) Delivery Order: Delivery Order is an essential document required to be
produced to take delivery of the material from the custodian and therefore
after depositing BSV, the Delivery Order should be issued and the delivery
should be made to purchaser or his agent on the strength of the Delivery
Order and after verifying cashier’s receipt.

10.8 Disposal through Auction
i) A ministry or Department may undertake auction of goods to be disposed of either
directly or through approved auctioneers;
ii) The basic principles to be followed here are similar to those applicable for disposal
through the advertised tender so as to ensure transparency, competition, fairness
and elimination of discretion. The auction plan including details of the goods to be
auctioned and their location, applicable terms and conditions of the sale, and so on,
should be given wide publicity in the same manner as is done in case of the
advertised tender;

iii) While starting the auction process, the condition and location of the goods to be
auctioned, applicable terms and conditions of sale, and so on, (as already indicated
earlier while giving wide publicity to it), should be announced again for the benefit of
the assembled bidders;

iv) During the auction process, acceptance or rejection of a bid should be announced
immediately on the stroke of the hammer. If a bid is accepted, SD (not less than 25
(twenty-five) per cent of the bid value) should immediately be taken on the spot from
the successful bidder either in cash or in the form of deposit-at-call-receipt, drawn in
favour of the FA of the disposing organisation. The goods should be handed over to
the successful bidder only after receiving the balance payment as in case of sale
through tenders;

v) The composition of the auction team will be decided by the CA. The team should
preferably include an officer of the internal finance wing of the Department and a
representative of security staff.

10.9

Disposal at scrap value or by other modes

If a ministry or Department is unable to sell any surplus or obsolete or unserviceable item at
the reserve price, in spite of its attempts through an advertised tender or auction, it may

177

dispose it off at its scrap value with the approval of the CA in consultation with the
Associated/ integrated Finance. In case the ministry or Department is unable to sell the item
even at its scrap value, it may adopt any other mode of disposal including destruction of the
item in an eco-friendly manner.

10.10 Delivery of Sold Material
10.10.1

Free Delivery Time and Ground Rent

Delivery has to be taken within 30 (thirty) calendar days (called free delivery period) from the
date of the acceptance letter/sale order (excluding the date of issue of acceptance letter/sale
order). The delivery of material will be given only after realisation of the demand draft/pay
order. If the purchaser is not able to lift the material within the free delivery period, he may
request for an extension. Such extensions are generally granted after levying a ground rent
@ 1/2 (half) per cent of the sale value per day. But, in some genuine cases, the levy of
ground rent may be waived. An accounts representative will be responsible for seeing that
when the ground rent has become due, it is recovered by the stock-holder before delivery of
the stores. The amount realised as ground rent should be noted in the issue note by the
stock holder and certified by the stock verifier. The stock-holder will be responsible for
remitting the cash to the cashier and obtaining a receipt.
10.10.2

All Risks to the Buyer

The items shall remain, in every aspect, at the risk of the buyer from the time of acceptance
of his offer. The seller will not undertake any liability whatsoever for the safe custody,
protection or preservation after the sale has been confirmed. Lots are put up for sale, subject
to change by nature’s wear and tear. No complaint regarding the quality or description of the
materials sold will be entertained once the bid has been accepted.
10.10.3

Terms of Delivery

No picking, choosing, sorting, welding, cutting or breaking of goods or materials sold will be
permitted unless otherwise specified. In used/waste oil, separation of oil and water, and so
on, shall not be allowed at the site. If these actions are allowed, there is possibility of
leakages. In mixed lots, the buyer may take undue advantage by leaving cheaper
components behind. If whole machinery is sold and cutting and breaking is allowed, it would
be difficult to ensure that the purchaser is taking out only his own cut material and not other
unsold material or from other scrap lots. If any foreign materials are found to be mixed in the
lot, other than the items included in the auction catalogue and acceptance letter/sale order,
the seller reserves the right to remove them at the time of delivery. The buyer shall not be
entitled to re-sell an item, lot or part of a lot while the goods are still lying within the premises
of the seller and any such sale or assignment of the buyer’s right to the material sold in an
auction will not be recognised. All documents for releasing materials will be made out in the
name of the buyer only.
The material will be delivered only to the successful bidder or his authorised representatives
against the presentation of the buyer’s identity proof. If the successful bidder desires to
authorise a representative or an agent to accept delivery, the bidder shall produce a suitable
power of attorney or authorisation letter for each lot separately, duly attested, by a notary
public authorising his representative or agent to lift the material from the seller.
10.10.4

Default by Seller

178

The seller will not be, in any way, responsible for failure to deliver the material due to causes
beyond his control such as a strike, lockout, cessation of work by labourers, shortened
hours, act of God or other causes or other contingencies whatsoever. The buyer shall not be
entitled to cancel the contract and the period of delivery shall automatically be extended
proportionately.
10.10.5
Default by Buyer
Materials sold but not removed within the specified date will become the property of the
seller and it will have the right to dispose of such goods in any manner as he deems fit
without any notice.
10.10.6
Witnessing Delivery
All materials sold shall be weighed or counted before delivery, this being supervised by the:
i) Stock-holder’s representative;
ii) Accounts representative – stock-verifier;
iii) Representative of the security force of a rank not less than constable; and
iv) Representative of the purchaser (if he wants to be present).
10.10.7
Deliveries of Scrap
At the time of delivery of scrap material to the purchaser, the weighment is to be done in the
presence of the stockholder’s representative, so nominated by the Head of Office. The
stockholder’s representative and accounts representative will sign a joint statement
indicating the type of scrap, name of the party to whom scrap is delivered and quantity as
per the weighment slip. The stock-holder should arrange for the deliveries to be affected
according to the agreement and terms and conditions of sale. He should take every possible
step to expedite delivery of the auctioned materials. The stock verifier should count,
measure or weigh each lot or part of a lot after comparison of the description and quantity
shown in the sold lot to ensure that only such kinds and quantities of materials as have been
shown in the sold lot are being issued; he should sign the gate passes and issue notes in
token of such a check. In giving delivery of scrap of non-ferrous items, the material should
be weighed on electronic weighing scales and the weight of each consignment should be
recorded in detail by the stock verifier in his field book. All deliveries should be done through
Electronic Weigh Bridges. All the Weigh Bridges should have valid certificate from Weight &
Measurement Department of the State Government.
He should sign the issue note after fully satisfying himself that entries made therein agree
with those in the field book. The field book should be attested by the other representatives
making delivery of the goods in token of their having accepted the correctness thereof.
The empty and loaded trucks or carts should be weighed and particulars of the gate pass
issued recorded. The issue note and gate pass should be countersigned by the stock
verifier.
The loading of the sold materials should be done under the supervision of the stock-holder
and be witnessed by other representatives. The stock-holder will be responsible for realising
the loading charges, if any, from the purchaser.
10.10.8
Variation in Available Quantity
At the time of delivery, the actual quantity may vary from the quantity mentioned in the
delivery order. In case of excess available material, the seller reserves the right to retain

179

material in excess of quantity in the lot at its discretion. The purchaser may be allowed to lift
the additional quantity after making the requisite additional payment to the seller.
If the quantity in a lot on actual weighment or count is less than the announced quantity, the
seller will not make good the deficiency under any circumstances. The purchaser thereof will
be entitled to obtain a refund for the undelivered quantity at the quoted rate. No interest will
be paid on the amount of short delivered quantity. The reasons for shortfall should be
recorded by the stock-holder and the Head of Office (or any other officer as per SoPP)
should also record his opinion. Any refund in this regard will be made with the Head of
Office’s (or any other officer as per SoPP) recommendation, the Associated/ integrated
Finance’s concurrence and CA’ approval. Copies of the weighment slip will be the base for
determining the refund amount. It may be necessary to look into the ledgers for the total
quantity held by the stock-holder and particularly so in the case of non-ferrous scrap; the
item concerned may have to be processed for special stock verification. In case of a short
delivery of the material, the refund of taxes will be the responsibility of the successful bidder
only.
10.10.9
Conclusion of Delivery
The seller’s responsibility ends after the consignment has been loaded and handed over to
the representative of the purchasers. The seller will be no party to any dispute that may arise
after the loading has been completed. At the conclusion of the delivery of the lot or lots,
pertaining to the item of scrap, any stock, left over should be verified by the Accounts
Department with the book balance and any discrepancies adjusted. Such “left over” stock
may be transferred to fresh scrap of similar description. At the conclusion, a report of sale
account of goods disposed has to be submitted to the CA and FA, to show that only the
material paid for (and nothing else) has been disposed of and that all payments due (and
nothing less) have been credited to the relevant accounts. A format of the report is shown in
Annexure 25

10.11
Accounts

Procedure for Adjustment of Sale Proceeds in the Books of

The following procedure may be followed for adjustment of sale proceeds in the books of
accounts:
a) If the realised price is more than the book value, the sale proceeds should first be
applied towards the ‘head of account’ in which the book value is lying, and the
remaining portion should be treated as “profit on sale of capital asset”; and
b) If the realised price is less than the book value, it should be apportioned in the ratio
of the reserve price of the equipment and that of the spares. In this case, the CA’s
sanction to write off the difference between the book value and the realised price
would be necessary.

Insert the defining parameters like Speed or defining technology here
89

ensure that low capability vendors do not vitiate competition.
90
Fill up a reasonable number. In a new technology product, the Manufacturer is not likely to meet the

Note: In case of Indian Bidders/ companies (manufacturer or principal of authorised representative) who have
been restructured by Banks in India, under the statutory guidelines, they would be deemed to have qualified the
Financial standing criteria considering the institutional financial backing available to them.

Applicability in Special Cases:
a) Applicability to ‘Make in India’ :Bidders (manufacturer or principal of authorised
representative) who have a valid/ approved ongoing ‘Make in India’ agreement/ program and
who while meeting all other criteria above, except for any or more of sub-criteria in
Experience and Past Performance above, would also be considered to be qualified provided:

1) their foreign ‘Make-in-India’ associates meets all the criteria above without exemption, and
2) the Bidder submits appropriate documentary proof for a valid/ approved ongoing ‘Make in
India’ agreement/ program.

3) the bidder (manufacturer or principal of authorised representative) furnishes along with the
bid a legally enforceable undertaking jointly executed by himself and such foreign
Manufacturer for satisfactory manufacture, Supply (and erection, commissioning if
applicable) and performance of ‘The Product’ offered including all warranty obligations as per
the general and special conditions of contract.
b)
Authorized Representatives: Bids of bidders quoting as authorised representative of a
principal manufacturer would also be considered to be qualified, provided:
1)

their principal manufacturer meets all the criteria above without exemption, and

2) the principal manufacturer furnishes a legally enforceable tender-specific authorisation
in the prescribed form assuring full guarantee and warranty obligations as per the
general and special conditions of contract; and
3) the bidder himself should have been associated, as authorised representative of the
same or other Principal Manufacturer for same set of services as in present bid (supply,
installation, satisfactorily commissioning, after sales service as the case may be) for
same or similar ‘Product’ for past three years ending on ‘The Relevant Date’.
c) For Existing successful Past Suppliers: In case the bidder (manufacturer or principal of
authorised representative) who is a successful past supplier of ‘The Product’ in at least one

d) Joint Ventures and Holding Companies: Credentials of the partners of Joint ventures cannot
(repeat cannot) be clubbed for the purpose of compliance of PQC in supply of Goods/
Equipment, and each partner must comply with all the PQC criteria independently. However
for the purpose of qualifying the Financial Standing Criteria, the Financial Standing
credentials of a Holding Company can be clubbed with only one of the fully owned subsidiary
bidding company, with appropriate legal documents proving such ownership.
NOTE FOR BIDDERS:
a)

Doctrine of Substantial Compliance’: The Pre-Qualification Bidding (PQB) and PreQualification Criteria (PQC) are for shortlisting of sources who are competent to perform
this contract to ensure best value for money from expenditure of Public Money. This
process is neither intended to bestow any entitlement upon nor to create any rights or
privileges for the Bidders, by way of overly hair-splitting or viciously legalistic
interpretations of these criteria, disregarding the very rationale of the PQB and PQC.
Keeping this caveat in view, interpretation by Procuring Entity would be based on

206

common usage of terminologies and phrases in public procurement in accordance with
the ‘Doctrine of Substantial Compliance’ and would be final.
b)

Along with all the necessary documents/ certificates required as per the tender
conditions, the bidder should furnish a brief write-up, backed with adequate data,
explaining his available capacity (both technical and financial), for manufacture and
supply of the required goods/equipment, within the specified time of completion, after
meeting all their current commitments.

c)

Supporting documents submitted by the bidder must be certified as follows:

i)

All copy of supply/work order; respective completion certificate and contact details of
clients; documents issued by the relevant Industries Department/ National Small Industries
Corporation (NSIC)/ manufacturing licence; annual report, etc., in support of experience,
past performance and capacity/capability should be authenticated by the by the person
authorised to sign the tender on behalf of the bidder. Original Documents must be
submitted for inspection, if so demanded.

ii) All financial standing data should be certified by certified accountants, for example,
Chartered Accountants/ Cost Accountants or equivalent in relevant countries; and Indian
bidder or Indian counterparts of foreign bidders should furnish their Permanent Account
Number.

Annexure 15: Example of Formula for Price Variation Clause
(Refer Para 6.6)
(The formula for price variation should ordinarily include a fixed element, a material element
and a labour element. The figures representing the material element and the labour element
should reflect the corresponding proportion of input costs, while the fixed element may range
from 10 to 25% (ten to twenty-five percent). That portion of the price represented by the fixed
element and profits and is not subject to variation. The portions of the price represented by
the material element and labour element along will attract price variation.)
The formula for price variation will thus be:!"

$"

&' + " )!# * + + )$#*,
!" = !$ %
/ − !$
100
Where: Pa is then adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus figure will indicate a reduction
in the contract price) on the date of supply.
Po is the contract price on the base date (which is taken as the date on which tender is due
to open).
F is the fixed element (as the percentage of the total price) not subject to price variation.
a is the assigned percentage to the material element in the contract price.
b is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the contract price.
(F, a and b being percentages should total 100)
Lo and L1 are the average wage indices for the quarter before the quarter in which base
month falls and for the quarter before the quarter in which date of supply falls; respectively.
For example for a tender opening on March 17, 2016 (base date), Lo would be average
wage index for the quarter of Oct-Dec 2015.
Mo and M1 are the material prices/indices as average of the month, two month prior to the
month in which base month falls and average of the month, two month prior to the month in
which date of supply falls, respectively. For example, for a tender opening on March 17,
2016 (base date), Mo would be prices/index as average of the month of January 2016. All
material prices/indices will be basic prices without excise duty and without any other central,
state, local taxes and duties and Octroi.
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element can be broken up
into two or three components such as Mx, My, Mz.
The following conditions would be applicable to price adjustment:
•

Base dates shall be due dates of opening of bids (technical bid in two or three
envelop/cover system).

•

Date of supply shall be the date of calculation/determination of the price variation.

•

No price increase is allowed beyond original delivery period.

214

•

No price adjustment shall be payable on the portion of contract price paid to the seller as
an advance/interim payment after the date of such payment.

•

Total adjustment will be subject to maximum ceiling of ____%.

•

No price adjustment shall be payable if this is less than or equal to 2% (two percent) of
Po.

•

Payments for each supply would initially be made as per the base price mentioned in the
contract. Price adjustment bill should be submitted only quarterly for the supplies made
during the quarter.

•

In GTE tenders extra care should be taken in selecting the price indices. Preferably the
price indices should be from the same country and of same currency as the country and
currency of the bidder. In case price is in a currency of a country where inflation is low
!"

$"

and the indices are from country with much higher inflation rates, )!#* and )$#* should
%#

be multiplied by a correction factor of exchange rates)%"*, where E0 is the exchange rate
of country of M and L indices with reference to currency of price P. For example, if M&L
are from India and P is in $, then Eo is Number of Rs. in a $ on base date and E1 is the
exchange rate on determination date.
•

Even if there is no price adjustment claim, supplier must submit all relevant data to prove
that there is no downward variation. In any case he must submit a declaration as follows;

“It is certified that there has been no decrease in the price of price variation indices
and in the event of any decrease of such indices during the currency of this contract we shall
promptly notify the same to the purchaser and offer requisite reduction in the contract rate.”

APPENDIX

Appendix 1: Advanced Concepts of Value for Money
1.0

The Concept of Value

Value is a management and economics concept. It represents the extent of satiation of a
hierarchy of needs of a person by a product bought for this purpose. This is subjective and
difficult to quantify. This is because different persons (or the same persons under different
circumstances) would have different hierarchy of needs and would perceive different extents
of satiation or value from the same product. There are three sources of the value of a
product. The first source of value is from the functional usage of the product (known as use
value) and the second source comes from the social status associated with the ownership of
the product (esteem value). This can be shown as the difference between a luxury branded
gold-plated, diamond encrusted pen and a disposable non-descript functional pen, though
both fulfil the broadly same function and have the same use value. The luxury branded pen,
in addition to the use value, also has additional esteem value. The third source of value
comes from the price that one can get by exchanging or scrapping the product at the end of
the useful life of the product. This is called the disposal value. Normally, when people buy a
car, they do consider the estimated disposal value of different choices of models. Value is
the sum total of all the three values.

2.0

Total Cost of Ownership

While the value of a product covers all components of value over the “Whole-Of-Life” (WOL),
the costs incurred on the product should also take into consideration the total of various
elements of costs incurred over WOL of the product. For this purpose, future costs are
discounted to present value (not to be confused with the value we are discussing – this is a
financial discounting concept). For example, it would not be prudent to buy a cheap car,
which has a very high cost of operating. This is called variously as WOL or “Life-Time-Cost”
(LCC) or “Total Cost of Ownership” (TCO). The last is a preferred nomenclature in
procurement and is defined as the total of all costs associated with a product, service, or
capital equipment that are incurred over its expected life. Typically, these costs can be
broken into four broad categories:

i) Procurement price. The amount paid to the vendor/ contractor for the product,
service, or capital equipment;

ii) Acquisition costs. All costs associated with bringing the product, service, or capital
equipment into operation at the customer's location. Examples of acquisition costs
are sourcing, administration, freight, taxes, and so on;

iii) Usage costs. In the case of a product, all costs associated with converting the
procured part/material into the finished product and supporting it through its usable
life. In the case of a service, all costs associated with the performance of the service
that is not included in the procurement price. In the case of capital equipment, all
costs associated with operating the equipment through its life. Examples of usage
costs are inventory, conversion, wastage, lost productivity, lost sales, warranty,
installation, training, downtime, and so on; and

233

iv) End-of-life costs. All costs incurred when a product, service, or capital equipment
reaches the end of its usable life, net of amounts received from the sale of the
remaining product or the equipment (disposal value) as the case may be. Examples
of end-of-life costs are obsolescence, disposal, clean-up, and project termination
costs

3.0

Value for Money

Besides value of a product or service, the customer also has his own notion of “value” of a
particular sum of money. This is different for different people or even for the same person in
different circumstances. When the perceived value of a product matches the perceived value
of the amount of money (cost of the product), the customer feels he got the full value for his
money. This is called the VfM. In procurement, Total Cost of Ownership is taken to evaluate
value for money. Given the limited resources available to the Government, ensuring VfM in
procurement is the key to ensuring the optimum utilisation of scarce budgetary resources. It
usually means buying the product or service with the lowest WOL costs that is ‘fit for
purpose’ and just meets the specification. VfM also incorporates affordability; clearly, goods
or services that are unaffordable cannot be bought. This should be addressed as soon as
possible within the process, ideally at the need assessment stage before procurement
commences. In order to address this issue, a change in the procurement approach,
specification or business strategy may be required.
Where an alternative is chosen that does not have the lowest WOL costs, then the additional
‘value added’ benefit must be proportional and objectively justifiable. Assessment of bids
should be conducted only in relation to a published set of evaluation criteria (which should
be relevant to the subject of the contract), and any ‘added value’ that justifies a higher price
must flow from these defined criteria. In public procurement VfM is often primarily
established through the competitive process. A strong competition from a vibrant market will
generally deliver a VfM outcome. However, where competition is limited, or even absent,
other routes may have to be used to establish VfM. These can include benchmarking,
construction of theoretical cost models or ‘shadow’ bids by the procurement agency. For
major contracts, this can require considerable financial expertise and external support. A
VfM assessment, based on the published conditions for participation and evaluation, may
include consideration of some factors such as:

i) Fitness for purpose;
ii) Potential vendor/contractor’s experience and performance history;
iii) Flexibility (including innovation and adaptability over the lifecycle of the procurement);
iv) Environmental sustainability (such as energy efficiency and environmental impact); and
v) Total cost of ownership
But due to uncertainties in estimates of various components of TCO (and actual costs over
the life-cycle) and intangibles of Value, some element of subjectivity may become
unavoidable, and hence is not normally useable in routine Public Procurement cases.
Therefore preference is given to alternative means for ensuring VfM by way of optimal
description of needs; development of value-engineered specifications/ Terms of Reference
and appropriate packaging/ slicing of requirements and selection of appropriate mode/
bidding systems of procurement etc.

234

Appendix– 2: Legal Aspects of Public Procurement
1.0

Relevant Provisions of the Constitution of India

1.1
Equality for Bidders
Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India
(under Part III – ‘Fundamental Rights’) grants
all its citizens the right “to practise any
profession or to carry out any occupation,
trade or business”. This has been interpreted
by courts in a way so as to ensure that every
citizen of India has a right to get equal
opportunity to bid for and be considered for a
public procurement contract. However, this
provision does permit stipulation of reasonable
eligibility or pre-qualification criteria for the
selection of successful bidders in a public
procurement contract. Thus a public
procurement organisation should be ready to
prove in court that no eligible bidder has been
denied reasonable and equal opportunity
under this article to bid and be considered for
the concerned contract.

“Part III - FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS - Right to
Freedom
§19 Protection of certain rights regarding
freedom of speech, etc.
1. All citizens shall have the right(a) to freedom of speech and expression;
(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;
(c) to form associations or unions;
(d) to move freely throughout the territory of
India;
(e) to reside and settle in any part of the
territory of India; [and]
(f) to practise any profession, or to carry
on any occupation, trade or business.”

“Part XII. - Finance, Property, Contracts and
Suits
§299 Contracts:
All contracts made in the exercise of the
executive power of the Union or of a State
shall be expressed to be made by the
President, or by the Governor of the State, as
the case may be, and all such contracts and
all assurances of property made in the
exercise of that power shall be executed on
behalf of the President or the Governor by
such persons and in such manner as he may
direct or authorise.
Neither the President nor the Governor shall
be personally liable in respect of any contract
or assurance made or executed for the
purposes of this Constitution, or for the
purposes of any enactment relating to the
Government of India heretofore in force, nor
shall any person making or executing any
such contract or assurance on behalf of any
of them be personally liable in respect
thereof.”

1.2
Persons Authorised to Make and
Execute Contracts on Behalf of
Governments
As per Article 299 (Part XII – Finance,
Property, Contracts and Suits) of the
Constitution of India, all contracts on behalf of
the Union Government or state Governments
are to be entered into and executed by
authorised persons on behalf of the President
of India or Governor of the state, respectively.
The President of India, Governor of the state
and the authorised persons who enter into or
execute such contracts are granted immunity
from personal liability under this article. That is
why, above the signatures of such persons, on
the contract documents, a legal phrase “For
and on Behalf of the President of India/the
Governor of State” is written to signify this fact.
In a state Government, the persons who are
authorised to do so are listed in the DFPR.
Provisions of DFPR are expanded upon by various Departments by issuing SoPP. Rule 224
(1) & (2), Chapter 8: Contract Management of the GFR, 2017 covers this aspect also

235

1.3
Other Mercantile Laws
A procurement contract besides being a commercial transaction is also a legal transaction.
There are a number of commercial/mercantile laws that are applicable equally to the private
sector and public procurement, such as the Indian Contract Act, Sales of Goods Act,
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and so on. Although a public procurement professional is
expected to have a working knowledge of the following basic laws relating to procurement,
yet he is not expected to be a legal expert. If standard contract forms are used, the
procurement official can discharge his normal functions without frequent legal help. In case
any complex legal issue arises, or a complex contract beyond the standard contract form is
to be drafted, an appropriate legal professional may be associated with the procurement
from an early stage.
Salient features of these mercantile laws relating to Procurement are summarised below.

2.0

Salient Features of the Indian Contract Act

2.1
Legal Aspects Governing Public Procurement of Goods - Introduction
A public procurement contract, besides being a commercial transaction, is also a legal
transaction. There are a number of laws that may affect various commercial aspects of
public procurement contracts. A public procurement professional is expected to be generally
aware of the implications of following basic laws affecting procurement of goods; however,
he or she is not expected to be a legal expert. Where appropriate in complex cases, legal
advice may be obtained. In other categories of procurement, additional set of laws may be
relevant:

i) The Constitution of India;
ii) Indian Contracts Act, 1872;
iii) Sale of Goods Act, 1930;
iv) Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with the Arbitration and Conciliation
(Amendment) Act, 2015 and 2021;
v) Competition Act, 2002 as amended with Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007;
vi) Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSME Development) Act, 2006;
vii) Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act, regarding e-procurement and e-auction,
popularly called the Cyber Law);
viii)Right to Information (RTI) Act 2005;
ix) Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003;
x) Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (basis of the Central Bureau of
Investigation);
xi) Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988;
xii) The Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 and the Foreign Trade
Policy (EXIM Policy), 2015; Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 and
FEMA (Current Account Transactions) Rules, 2000.
The elements and principles of contract law and the meaning and import of various legal
terms used in connection with the contracts are available in the Indian Contract Act, 1872
read with the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Some of the salient principles relating to contracts
are set out briefly in this chapter.
2.2

Elementary Legal Practices

236

2.2.1What is a Contract? The proposal or offer when accepted is a promise, a promise
and every set of promises forming the consideration for each other is an agreement
and an agreement if made with free consent of parties competent to contract, for a
lawful consideration and with a lawful object is a contract.
2.2.2ProposalorOffer:When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to
abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of the other to such
act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal or offer. In a sale or purchase by
tender, the tender signed by the tenderer is the proposal. The invitation to tender
and instructions to tenderers do not constitute a proposal.
2.2.3

Acceptance of the Proposal: When the person to whom the proposal is made
signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal when
accepted becomes a promise.
2.2.4 What agreements are contracts: An agreement is a contract enforceable by law
when the following are satisfied. A defect affecting any of these renders a contract
un-enforceable
i) Competency of the parties
ii) Freedom of consent of both parties
iii) Lawfulness of consideration
iv) Lawfulness of object
2.3

Competency of Parties

Under law any person who has attained majority and is of sound mind or not debarred by
law to which he is subject, may enter into contracts. It, therefore, follows that minors and
persons of unsound mind cannot enter into contracts nor can insolvent person do so.
2.3.1 Categories of persons and bodies who are parties to the contract maybe broadly
sub-divided under the following heads: i) Individuals
ii) Partnerships
iii) Limited Companies
iv) Corporations other than limited companies
a)
Contracts with Individuals: Individuals tender either in their own name or in the
name and style of their business. If the tender is signed by any person other than
the concerned individual, the authority of the person signing the tender on behalf of
another must be verified and a proper power of attorney authorizing such person
should be insisted on. In case, a tender is submitted in a business name and if it is
a concern of an individual, the constitution of the business and the capacity of the
individual must appear on the face of the contract and the tender signed by the
individual himself as proprietor or by his duly authorized attorney.
(b)
Contracts with Partnerships: A partnership is an association of two or more
individuals formed for the purpose of doing business jointly under a business
name. It is also called a firm. It should be noted that a partnership is not a legal
entity by itself, apart from the individuals constituting it. A partner is the implied
authority to bind the firm in a contract coming in the purview of the usual business
of the firm. The implied authority of a partner, however, does not extend to enter
into arbitration agreement on behalf of the firm. While entering into a contract with

237

partnership firm care should be taken to verify the existence of consent of all the
partners to the arbitration agreement.
(c)

Contracts with Limited Companies: Companies are associations of individuals
registered under Companies Act in which the liability of the members comprising
the association is limited to the extent of the shares held by them in such
companies. The company, after its incorporation or registration, is an artificial legal
person which has an existence quite distinct and separate from the members of
shareholders comprising the same. A company is not empowered to enter into a
contract for purposes not covered by its memorandum of association; any such
agreement in excess of power entered into the company is void and cannot be
enforced. Therefore, in cases of doubt, the company must be asked to produce its
memorandum for verification or the position may be verified by an inspection of the
memorandum from the office of the Registrar of Companies before entering into a
contract. Normally, any one of the Directors of the company is empowered to
present the company. Where tenders are signed by persons other than Directors or
authorized Managing Agents, it may be necessary to examine if the person signing
the tender is authorized by the company to enter into contracts on its behalf.

(d)

Corporation other than Limited Companies: Associations of individuals

as

CooperativeSocietiesActandSocietiesRegistrationActarealsoartificial persons in the
eye of law and are entitled to enter into such contracts as are authorized by their
memorandum of association. If any contract has to be entered into with any one or
such corporations or associations, the capacity of such associations to enter into
contract should be verified and also the authority of the person coming forward to
represent the said Association.

2.4

Consent of both Parties

Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same
sense. When two persons dealing with each other have their minds directed to different
objects or attach different meanings to the language which they use, there is no agreement.
The misunderstanding which is incompatible with agreement may occur in the following
cases: i)

When the misunderstanding relates to the identity of the other party to the
agreement;
ii) When it relates to the nature or terms of the transactions;
iii) When it related to the subject matter of the agreement.

2.5

Free consent of both Parties

2.5.1The consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence,
fraud, mis-representation or mistake. Consent is said to be so caused when it would not
have been given but for the existence of coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, undue
influence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract void able at the option of
the party whose consent was caused. A party to a contract, whose consent was caused by
fraud or misrepresentation may, if he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed,
and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations
made had been true.

238

2.5.2 In case consent to an agreement has been given under a mistake, the position is
slightly different. When both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter
essential to the agreement, the agreement is not voidable but void. When the mistake is
unilateral on the part of one party only, the agreement is not void.
2.5.3 Distinction has also to be drawn between a mistake off act and a mistake of law. A
contract is not void because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in India but a
mistake as to law not in force in India has the same effect as a mistake of fact.

2.6

Consideration

Consideration is something which is advantageous to the promisor or which is onerous or
disadvantageous to the promisee. Inadequacy of consideration is, however, not a ground
avoiding the contract. But an act, forbearance or promise which is contemplation of law has
no value is no consideration and likewise an actor a promise which is illegal or impossible
has no value.

2.7

Lawfulness of object

The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless it is forbidden by law or is of
such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent or
involves or implies injury to the fraudulent property of another or the court regards it as
immoral or opposed to public policy. In each of these cases the consideration or object of
an agreement is said to be unlawful.

2.8

Communication of an Offer or Proposal

The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the
person to whom it is made. A time is generally provided in the tender forms for submission
of the tender. Purchaser is not bound to consider a tender, which is received beyond that
time.

2.9

Communication of Acceptance

A date is invariably fixed in tender forms upto which tenders are open for acceptance. A
proposal or offer stands revoked by the lapse of time prescribed in such offer for its
acceptance. If, therefore, in case it is not possible to decide a tender within the period of
validity of the offer as originally made, the consent of the tenderer firm should be obtained
to keep the offer open for further period or periods.
2.9.1The communication of an acceptance is complete as against the proposer or offerer,
where it is put in the course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the
acceptor, and it is complete as against the acceptor when it comes to the knowledge of the
proposer or offerer. The medium of communication in Government contracts is generally by
post and the acceptance is, therefore, complete as soon as it is posted. So that there might
be no possibility of a dispute regarding the date of communication of acceptance, it should
be sent to the correct address by some authentic foolproof mode like registered post
acknowledgement due, etc.

2.10

Acceptance to be identical with Proposal

If the terms of the tender or the tender, as revised, and modified, are not accepted or if the
terms of the offer and the acceptance are not the same, the acceptance remains a mere
counter offer and there is no concluded contract. It should, therefore, be ensured that the

239

terms incorporated in the acceptance are not at variance with the offer or the tender and
that none of the terms of the tender are left out. In case, uncertain terms are used by the
tenderers, clarifications should be obtained before such tenders are considered for
acceptance. If it is considered that a counter offer should be made, such counter offer
should be carefully drafted, as a contract is to take effect on acceptance thereof.
If the subject matter of the contract is impossible of fulfilment or is in itself in violation of law
such contract is void.

2.11

Withdrawal of an Offer or Proposal

A tenderer firm, who is the proposer may withdraw its offer at any time before its
acceptance, even though the firm might have offered to keep the offer open for a specified
period. It is equally open to the tenderer to revise or modify his offer before its acceptance.
Such withdrawal, revision or modification must reach the accepting authority before the date
and time of opening of tender.
No legal obligations arise out of such withdrawal or revision or modification of the offer as a
simple offer is without a consideration. Where, however, a tenderer agrees to keep his offer
open for a specified period for a consideration, such offers cannot be withdrawn before the
expiry of the specified date. This would be so where earnest money is deposited by the
tenderer in consideration of his being supplied the subsidiary contract and withdrawal of
offer by the tenderer before the specified period would entitle the purchaser to forfeit the
earnest money.

2.12 Withdrawal of Acceptance
An acceptance can be withdrawn before such acceptance comes to the knowledge of the
tenderer. A telegraphic revocation of acceptance, which reaches the tenderer before the
letter of acceptance, will be a valid revocation.

2.13

Changes in terms of a concluded Contract

No variation in the terms of a concluded contract can be made without the consent of the
parties. While granting extensions or making any other variation, the consent of the
contractor must be taken. While extensions are to be granted on an application of the
contractor, the letter and spirit of the application should be kept in view in fixing a time for
delivery.

2.14

Discharge of Contracts

A contract is discharged or the parties are normally freed from the obligation of a contract
by due performance of the terms of the contract. A contract may also be discharged: i)

By mutual agreement: If neither party has performed the contract, no consideration
is required for the release. If a party has performed a part of the contract and has
undergone expenses in arranging to fulfil the contract it is necessary for the parties
to agree to a reasonable value of the work done as consideration for the value.
ii) By breach: In case a party to a contract breaks some stipulation in the contract
which goes to the root of transaction, or destroys the foundation of the contract or
prevents substantial performance of the contract, it discharges the innocent party to
proceed further with the performance and entitles him to a right of action for

240

damages and to enforce the remedies for such breach as provided in the contract
itself. A breach of contract may, however, be waived.
iii) By refusal of a party to perform: On a promisor’s refusal to perform the contract or
repudiation thereof even before the arrival of the time for performance, the promisee
may at his option treat the repudiation as an immediate breach putting an end to the
contract for the future. In such a case the promisee has a right of immediate action
for damages.
iv) In a contract where there are reciprocal promises: If one party to the contract
prevents the other party from performing the contract, the contract may be put to an
end at the instance of the party so prevented and the contract is thereby discharged.

2.15

Stamping of Contracts

Under entry 5 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, an agreement or memorandum of
agreement for or relating to the sale of goods or merchandise exclusively is exempt from
payment of stamp duty.(A note or memorandum sent by a Broker or Agent to his principal
intimating the purchase or sale on account of such principal is not so exempt from stamp
duty.)
The Stamp Act provides that no Stamp Duty shall be chargeable in respect of any
instrument executed by or on behalf of or in favour of the Government in cases where but
for such exemption Government would be liable to pay the duty chargeable in respect of
such instrument. (Cases in which Government would be liable are set out in Section 29 of
the Act).

2.16

Authority for Execution of Contracts

As per Clause 1 of Article 299 of the Constitution, the contracts and assurances of property
made in the exercise of the executive power of the Union shall be executed on behalf of the
President. The words “for and on behalf of the President of India” should therefore follow
the designation appended below the signature of the officer authorized in this behalf.
Note 1:
The various classes of contracts and assurances of property, which may be
executed by different authorities, are specified in the Notifications issued by the Ministry of
Law from time to time.
Note 2:
The powers of various authorities, the conditions under which such powers
should be exercised and the general procedure prescribed with regard to various classes
of contracts and assurances of property are laid down in Rule 21 of the Delegation of
Financial Powers Rules.

2.17

Contract Effective Date

The date of commencement of the obligations under the contract on the parties to a
contract is referred as the contract effective date. This date should be invariably indicated in
each contract, as per agreed terms and conditions. The Ministries/Departments are advised
to set the effective date to be a date after the following:
i) Date of signing of the contract.
ii) Furnishing of performance bond in terms of performance security.
iii) Receipt of Bank Guarantee for advance payment.

241

iv) Obtaining Export Licence for supply of stores by seller and confirmation by the
buyer.
v) Receipt of End User's Certificate. The supplier shall provide the End User's
Certificate within 30 (thirty) days of the signing of the contract.

3.0

Salient Features of the Sales of Goods Act, 1930

3.1
Scope
Agreements for the sale of goods are governed by the general principles of the contract law.
A contract for sale of goods has, however, certain peculiar features such as transfer of
ownership of the goods and quality aspects implied under a contract for sale of goods, and
so on, are not covered in the Contract Act. These peculiarities are the subject matter of the
provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. In this act, the two parties to the contract are
called “seller” and “buyer”. This act defines goods, for the purpose of applicability of this act,
as every kind of movable property, including stocks and shares, growing crops, goodwill,
patents, trademarks, electricity, water, gas, and so on—all that can be exchanged for money
but not any kind of immovable property (for example, real estate).
3.2
Concept of Transfer of Property (Passing of Title)
Proprietary (ownership) rights and obligations in “goods” are called legally “title to goods” or
“property in goods”. The meaning of property here is different from the common connotation
of the word. At what point of time or stage in a contract does this passing of title of (property
in) goods happen is laid down by this Act. This ownership of goods is different from
'possession of goods' which means the physical custody or control of the goods. Delivery of
goods is only a transfer of ‘possession of goods”; and may or may not coincide with the
passing of title in goods. This distinction is very important in procurement.
The transfer of property in the goods, from the seller to the buyer, is the essence of a
procurement of goods. Therefore, the moment when the property in goods passes from the
seller to the buyer is significant for following reasons:
3.3
Ownership
The moment the property in goods passes, the seller ceases to be their owner and the buyer
acquires the ownership. The buyer can exercise proprietary rights over the goods. For
example, the buyer may sue the seller for non-delivery of the goods or when the seller has
resold the goods, and so on.
3.4
Concept of “Res Prit Domine” -- Risk Follows Ownership
This concept simply means that, as a general rule, risk follows the ownership, irrespective of
whether the delivery (or transfer of possession of goods) has been made or not. If the goods
are damaged or destroyed, the loss shall be borne by the person who was the owner of the
goods at that time – irrespective of whosoever is in the “possession of the goods”.
3.5
Action against Third parties
When the goods are, in any way, damaged or destroyed by the action of third parties, it is
only the owner of the goods who can take action (claim, litigation) against them.
3.6
Time at which Property in Goods is Transferred
The property in goods is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract
intend this to happen, as recorded in the terms of the contract. This needs neither to
coincide with the point when payment is made nor with the delivery of Goods and not even
with the point of time when the seller dispatches the goods.
3.7

Document of Title to Goods

242

These are the voucher, bill, document, receipt, cash memo, bill of lading, lorry receipt,
railway receipt, or any such acknowledgement which proves the ownership of the goods
that, in the ordinary course of business, the buyer may receive. These are called documents
of title to goods.
3.8
Doctrine of Caveat Emptor
The Sales of Goods Act lays down this important concept that the buyer must act with due
diligence when buying goods; it is not a seller’s duty to point out the defects in goods. This is
a doctrine which is not in consonance with modern times but, unfortunately, is a legal
position. This, however, does not apply if the buyer’s consent to buy is obtained by the seller
by knowingly concealing the defects which could not have been discovered by the buyer
reasonably at the time of procurement. The caveat emptor is also diluted under some
implied conditions in a contract for sale.
3.9
Provision of the Act regarding Statutory Variations in Taxes and Duties
Statutory variations in the taxes and duties (customs duties, excise duty, tax on the sale or
procurement of goods), after the making of any contract, has to be borne by the buyer even
if there is no such express stipulation in the contract.

4.0

Salient Features of the Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996

Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 provides for dispute settlement either by a process
of conciliation and/or by arbitration. This act is based on a 'United Nation’s Commission on
International Trade Law Model Arbitration Law' with an object to minimise the supervisory
role of courts in the arbitral process and to provide that every final arbitral award is enforced
in the same manner, as if it was a decree of the court. It covers both international and
domestic arbitration and conciliation.
4.1
Arbitration
Arbitration is one of the oldest methods of settling civil disputes arising out of and in the
course of performance of the contract between two or more persons by reference of the
dispute to an independent and impartial third person called the arbitrator, instead of litigating
the matter in the usual way through the courts. It saves time and expense, avoids
unnecessary technicalities and, at the same time, ensures “substantial justice within limits of
the law”.
4.2
Arbitrator, Arbitration and Arbitral Award
The person or persons appointed to determine differences and disputes are called the
arbitrator or arbitral tribunal. The proceeding before him is called arbitration proceedings.
The decision is called an Award. For the purpose of Law of Limitations, The Arbitration for a
particular dispute is deemed to have commenced on the date, on which a request for
arbitration is received by the respondent.
4.3
Arbitration Agreement
It is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes, which have
arisen or which may arise between them, in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether
contractual or non-contractual. The dispute resolution method of arbitration, as per the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, can be invoked only if there is an arbitration agreement (in
the form of an arbitration clause or a separate arbitration agreement) in the contract. If there
is such an agreement, courts are barred from directly entertaining any litigation in respect of
such contracts, and are bound instead to refer the parties to arbitration.

243

4.4
Appointment and Composition of Arbitral Tribunal
Both parties can mutually agree on the number of arbitrators (which cannot be an even
number) to be appointed. In case there is no agreement, a single (sole) arbitrator may be
appointed. The parties can mutually agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or
arbitrators, or else in case of arbitration with three arbitrators, each party will appoint one
arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators will appoint the third arbitrator, who will act as a
presiding arbitrator. If one party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 (thirty) days, or if the
two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator, then the court may appoint any
person or institution as arbitrator. In case of an international commercial dispute, the
application for appointment of arbitrator has to be made to the Chief Justice of India. In case
of other domestic disputes, the application has to be made to the Chief Justice of the High
Court within whose jurisdiction the parties are situated.
4.5
Challenge to Appointment of Arbitrator
An arbitrator is expected to be independent and impartial. If there are some circumstances
due to which his independence or impartiality can be challenged, he must disclose the
circumstances before his appointment. The appointment of an arbitrator cannot be
challenged on any ground, except when there is justifiable doubt as to the arbitrator’s
independence or impartiality or when he does not possess the qualifications for the arbitrator
agreed to by the parties. The challenge to appointment has to be decided by the arbitrator
himself. If he does not accept the challenge, the arbitration can continue and the arbitrator
can make the arbitral award. However, in such a case, application for setting aside the
arbitral award can be made to the court, after the award is made by the arbitrator. Thus the
other party cannot stall further arbitration proceedings by rushing to court.
4.6
Conduct of Arbitral Proceedings
The parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed for conducting proceedings,
location, language of hearings and written proceedings. Failing any agreement, the arbitral
tribunal may decide themselves on these aspects. The parties shall be treated with equality
and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present its case. The arbitral tribunal shall
observe the rules of natural justice but is bound neither by Civil Procedure Code 1908 nor by
Indian Evidence Act 1872. Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable from the date of
commencement of arbitral proceedings. Arbitral tribunals have powers to do the following:

i) Determine admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence;
ii) Decide on their own jurisdiction;
iii) Decide on interim measures;
iv) Termination of proceedings; and
v) Seek court assistance in taking evidence.
4.7
Arbitral Award
The decision of the arbitral tribunal is termed as 'arbitral award'. The decision of arbitral
tribunal shall be by majority. The arbitral award shall be in writing, mentioning the place and
date, and signed by the members of the tribunal. It must state the reasons for the award. A
copy of the award should be given to each party. The tribunal can make interim award also.
An arbitral award is enforceable in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court.
4.8

Recourse against Arbitral Award

244

Recourse to a court against an arbitration award can be made by an application (within three
months from the date of the arbitral award), only on the grounds specified in the act, that is,
the party was under some incapacity; arbitration agreement was not valid; proper opportunity
was not given to present the case; award deal with disputes not falling within the terms of
reference of arbitrator; composition of the arbitral tribunal is not as per agreement of parties;
subject matter of dispute is not capable of settlement through arbitration under the law or the
arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy.
4.9
Conciliation
This is a new concept added in the Act for settlement of disputes. The party initiating
conciliation shall send a written invitation to the other party to conciliate and proceedings
shall commence when the other party accepts the initiations to conciliation. The parties may
agree on the name of a sole conciliator or each party may appoint one conciliator. The
conciliation shall assist the parties to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute. When
the parties sign the settlement agreement, it shall be final and binding on the parties. The
conciliator shall authenticate the settlement agreement and furnish a copy thereof to each
party. This process has not yet come into a common use.
4.10
i)

Changes introduced by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015
Independence, Disqualification and Obligations of arbitrators at the time of
appointment
a) Independence, Impartiality and Accountability of Arbitrators: A fixed fee
structure ensures the independence of the arbitral tribunal and also provides a
reasonable cost estimate to the parties entering into arbitration. The
Amendment Act in the Fourth Schedule prescribes the model fees for
arbitrators and the High Courts have been assigned the responsibility of
framing the rules for determination of the fees and the manner of its payment.
The model fee varies from Rs 45,000 to Rs 30 Lakh (Rupees forty-five to
rupees thirty lakh) for various slabs of disputed value from Rupees five Lakh to
above Rs 20 (Rupees twenty) Crore (with a sole arbitrator entitles to 25%
(twenty-five percent) extra above the model fee).However it is clarified that
such fees shall not be applicable in International Commercial Arbitration and in
cases where parties have agreed for determination of fees as per the rules of
an arbitral institution.

b) Disqualification from appointment: A long and exhaustive list of specific
circumstances which shall act as a bar against any person from being
appointed as an arbitrator in a dispute, have been enumerated in the seventh
schedule. However, the parties to the dispute have been given the opportunity,
after the dispute has arisen, to waive the applicability of the seventh schedule,
by mutual written agreement, if they so deem fit. Especially of interest in Public
Procurement is disqualification of past or present employees, consultant,
advisors or other related business relationship not only with the Procuring
Entity but also with any affiliated entity thereof. Thus the earlier practice of
appointing serving officers of procuring entity as arbitrator is no more legal.

c) Disclosures: An arbitrator who is approached for appointment is obligated to
disclose as per Sixth Schedule of the Act. The declaration as per a set format
removes any ambiguity and ensures uniformity:

245

1. conflict of Interest the existence either direct or indirect, of any past or
present relationship with or interest in any of the parties or in relation to
the subject matter in dispute, whether financial, business, professional or
other kind, which is likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his
independence or impartiality as per fifth schedule to the Act for arbitrator.
2. Time constraints: An arbitrator shall disclose all circumstances which may
affect his ability to deliver an award within 12 (twelve) months.
ii)

Fast-tracking Arbitration in India
a) Award within 12 (Twelve) months: The arbitral tribunal is statutorily obligated
to deliver an award within 12 (twelve) months from the date when arbitral tribunal
enters into reference. The arbitral tribunal is said to have entered upon the
reference on the date on which the arbitrator(s) have received notice of their
appointment. The award can be delayed by a maximum period of six months
only under the special circumstances where all parties give their consent to such
extension of time. Where the award is not made out within the statutory period
the mandate of arbitrators shall automatically terminate. It is open for the courts
to extend the time period for making an award upon receipt of an application by
any of the parties. Such extension is to be granted only for sufficient cause and
the court in its discretion may impose the following penalties depending on the
facts and circumstances of the case:
1. Reduce the fees of arbitrators by up to 5% (five percent)for each month of
delay.
2. Substitute one or all the arbitrators.
3. Impose actual or exemplary costs on any of the parties.
b) Oral arguments to be held on a day-to-day basis: Oral arguments as far as
possible shall be heard by the arbitral tribunal on a day to day basis and no
adjournments shall be granted without sufficient cause. Provision for imposition of
exemplary cost on the party seeking adjournment without sufficient cause has also
been made.
c) Fast Track Procedure: The parties to arbitration may choose to opt for a new
fast track procedure either before or after the commencement of the arbitration. The
award in fast track arbitration is to be made out within six months. Where the Arbitral
Tribunal delivers the award within a period of six months the arbitral tribunal shall be
entitled to additional fees. The quantum of such additional fees shall be determined
by the parties. The salient features of the fast track arbitration are:
1.
Dispute is to be decided based on written pleadings only.
2.
Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power to call for clarifications in
addition to the written pleadings where it deems necessary.
3.
Oral hearing maybe held only if all the parties make a request or if the
arbitral tribunal considers it necessary.
4.
The parties are free to decide the fees of the arbitrator(s).
d)
Appointment within 60 (sixty) days: Whenever an application for appointment
of Arbitrator(s) is moved before a court such application shall be disposed of as
expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be made to dispose of the matter
within a period of sixty days from the date of service of notice on the opposite party. The

246

court while appointing arbitrators shall confine itself to the examination of the existence
of an arbitration agreement.
iii)
Procedural and Jurisprudence simplified
a) Arbitration to commence within 90 (ninety) days of interim relief: Where the court
grants interim relief before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration must
commence within 90 (ninety) days from such order of interim relief. The court however
has been given the authority to extend the period within which the arbitration must
commence, if it deems such extension necessary. The Act prohibits courts from
entertaining any application for interim relief once the arbitration has entered into
reference, unless the court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the
remedy provided under section 17 efficacious.
b) Powers of Interim Relief in Section 9 also to Arbitral Tribunal: The parties to
arbitration can now directly approach the arbitral tribunal for seeking interim relief on the
same grounds as were available to the parties under section 9 of the previous act.
Further, the tribunal has now been granted the powers of a court while making interim
awards in the proceedings before it.
c) Arbitral tribunal not bound to rule in accordance with terms of the contract: The
arbitral tribunal was previously bound to deliver an award in accordance with the terms of
the agreement and was required to take into consideration the ‘usages of the trade
applicable to the transaction’. Vide the Amendment the arbitral tribunal has been freed of
the obligation to only rule in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The arbitral
tribunal is only required to take the agreement into account while delivering its award and
is free to deviate from the terms of the agreement if the circumstances so warrant.
d) Act made applicable on International Commercial Arbitration with even seat outside
India: Part I of the act has been made applicable for limited purpose (listed below) on
International Commercial Arbitrations even in instances where the seat of the arbitration
is outside India, however giving freedom to exclude the applicability the Act by entering
into an agreement to this effect:

1) Seeking interim relief from courts [section 9]
2) Seeking the assistance of the court in taking evidence [section 27]
3) Appealing against the order of a court where the court refuses to refer the parties to
arbitration. [section 37(1) (a)]
4) Restricting the right to second appeal and preserving the right of parties to approach the
Supreme Court in appeal. [section 37 (3)]

5.0
Salient Features of Competition Act, 2002 relating to Anti-competitive
Practices
The Preamble of the Competition Act, 2002, provides for the establishment of a
Commission keeping in view of the economic development of the country to promote
and sustain competition in markets; prevent practices having adverse effect on
competition; protect consumer interest; and ensure freedom of trade carried on by
participants in Indian markets.
ii) The Act was amended by Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007 and again by
Competition (Amendment Act), 2009.
iii) In India, Competition Commission of India (“CCI”), formulated under the Competition
Act is a quasi-judicial and regulatory body entrusted with the task enforcement of the
i)

247

Competition Act, 2002. Apart from specific functions under the Competition Act, 2002
the CCI also has extra-territorial jurisdiction, inquiry into anticompetitive conduct,
sector-specific regulatory work, competition advocacy, power of appointment of
professional and experts, and procedure for investigation (in terms of regulating its
own procedure).
iv) Section 8 dealing with composition of Commission provides for a chairperson and not
less than two and not more than six members which are to be appointed by Central
Government. The CCI is vested with inquisitorial, investigative, regulatory,
adjudicatory and also advisory jurisdiction. Vast powers have been given to the
Commission and under Section 64, the Commission can frame regulations.
v) The Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) is another body entrusted with the
responsibility of hearing and disposing of appeals against any direction or decision or
order of the CCI. It also adjudicates on compensation claims arising from the findings
of the CCI or its own findings on appeals against the CCI orders and passes orders
on the recovery of compensation.
vi) Any person aggrieved by the order or decision of the CCI may prefer an appeal to the
Competition Appellate Tribunal (‘COMPAT’) within 60 (sixty) days from the date of
communication of such order or decision. The second and final appeal under Section
53T lies before the Supreme Court of India from the orders of the COMPAT within a
period of 60 (sixty) days from the date of communication of the order by the
COMPAT.
vii) CCI may initiate an inquiry:
a)
On its own motion on the basis of information and knowledge in its
possession, or
b)
On receipt of any information, in such manner and accompanied by
such fee as may be determined by regulations, from any person, consumer
or their association or trade association, or
c)
On receipt of a reference from the Central Government or a State
Government or a statutory authority
viii) The Act provides for Director General office as a separate investigative wing to assist
the CCI. The DG looks into the complaints received from the CCI and submits all
findings to it. DG is solely responsible for making enquiries, for examining documents
and for making investigations into complaints. The DG is vested under the Act with
powers of summoning of witnesses, examining them on oath, requiring the discovery
and production of documents, receiving evidence on affidavits, issuing commissions
for the examination of witnesses etc.
ix) The Act in Section 49 (3) lays down the advocacy function of CCI and lays down that
the CCI shall take suitable measures for the promotion of competition advocacy,
creating awareness and imparting training about competition issues. Section 32 of
the Act grants the CCI extra-territorial jurisdiction over anticompetitive conduct which
has an appreciable adverse effect on competition within India. Any anticompetitive
activity taking place outside India but having an appreciable adverse effect on
competition within India shall be subject to the application of the Competition Act.
x) Under Section 21 of the Act, any statutory authority can suo motto or on request of a
party in the course of a proceeding before it can make a reference to CCI. CCI shall
give its opinion within sixty days of receipt of such reference by such statutory

248

authority. Under the provisions of the Act, the authority which made reference shall
consider the opinion of the Commission and thereafter, give its findings recording
reasons on the issues referred to in the said opinion by CCI. Section 21A in the same
language provides for such reference by CCI to any statutory authority.
xi) The key provisions of the Competition Act include:
1) Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 dealing with anti-competitive agreements;
2) Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 which discusses abuse of
dominance;
3) Section 5 and 6 of the Competition Act, 2002 dealing with the regulation of
combinations.
xii) The term ‘agreement’, has been defined broadly in the Competition Act. It extends to
a mere ‘arrangement’, ‘understanding’ or ‘action in concert’, none of which need be in
writing or enforceable by law.
xiii) Section 3(1) of the Competition Act lays down that no enterprise or association of
enterprises or person or association of persons shall enter into any agreement in
respect of production, supply, distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or
provision of services, which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect
on competition within India. The Act prohibits an anti-competitive agreement and
declares that such an agreement shall be void.
xiv) Section 3(3) of the Competition Act deals with the horizontal agreements as it covers
the agreements between entities engaged in identical or similar trade of goods or
provision of services. It also includes cartels. The section covers:
1) Agreement entered into between enterprises or associations of enterprises
or persons or associations of persons or between any person and enterprise
2) Practice carried on by any association of enterprises or association of
persons
3) Decision taken by any association of enterprises or association of persons
xv) Section 3(3) of the Competition Act enlists four broad classifications of horizontal
agreements which are presumed to cause an appreciable adverse effect on
competition (AAEC) in India.
1) Agreements regarding Prices
2) Agreements regarding Quantity / Quality
3) Market Allocation
4) Bid Rigging
These four horizontal agreements are not presumed to have appreciable adverse effect
on competition and excluded from the provisions of Section 3(3) of the Competition Act,
2002 provided they are entered into by way of joint ventures and increase efficiency in
production, supply, distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or provision of
services.
Cartels, by their very nature are secretive and thus it is difficult to find the direct evidence
of their presence. The orders of the CCI clearly point that CCI relies on circumstantial
evidence, both economic and conduct-based, to reach its decision on the existence of a
cartel agreement.
The Act provides a definition for bid rigging and it covers agreements having effect of
eliminating or reducing competition for bids or adversely affecting or manipulating the
process for bidding:

249

1) Collusive bidding: Agreement between firms to divide the market, set prices
or limit production – involves, kickbacks and misrepresentation of
independence
2) Bid Rotation
3) Bid Suppression
4) Complementary Bidding
5) Subcontracting arrangements
6) Market Allocation
The Act gives wide discretion to CCI to frame the remedies to overcome the
anticompetitive situation:
1.
Declare Anticompetitive Agreements Void
2.
Impose Heavy Penalties

1) Penalty can be up to 10% (ten percent) of the average turnover for the last
three preceding financial years upon each of such persons or enterprises
which are parties to bid-rigging
2) Cartel, a penalty of up to three times of its profit for each year of the
continuance of such agreement or 10% (ten percent) of its turnover for each
year of the continuance of such agreement, whichever is higher
3. Order the parties to Cease & Desist
4. Modification of agreements
5. Remedy Damage to reputation
6. Fix Individual Liability
7. Grant Interim orders
8. Any other order as CCI deems fit
xvi)
Who can file the information: Raising issues regarding anti-competitive
behaviour for action by CCI under the act is called filing the information:
a) Any person, consumer or their association or trade association can file information
before the Commission.
b) Central Govt. or a State Govt. or a statutory authority can also make a reference to the
Commission for making an inquiry.
c) “Person” includes an individual, HUF, firm, company, local authority, cooperative or any
artificial juridical person.
xvii)
What are the issues on which information can be filed?
a) The information can be filed on the issues like anti-competitive agreements and abuse of
dominant position or a combination.
b) Class of consumers.
xviii)
The fee a) Rupees 5000/- (Five thousand only) in case of individual, or Hindu undivided family
(HUF), or Non-Government Organisation (NGO), or Consumer Association, or Cooperative Society, or Trust, duly registered under the respective Acts,
b) Rupees 20,000/-(twenty thousand only) in case of firms, companies having turnover in
the preceding year upto Rupees one Crore, and
c) Rupees 50,000/- (fifty thousand only) in case not covered under clause (a) or (b) above.

Appendix 3: Electronic Procurement (e-Procurement) and e-Auction
(The details given in this appendix are generic in nature are not prescriptive part of this
Manual of Policies and Procedures. Procuring Entities may settle and decide the details with
the service provider)

1.0

Electronic procurement (e-procurement) is the use of information and

communication technology (specially the internet) by the buyer in conducting procurement
processes with the vendors/ contractors for the acquisition of goods (supplies), works and
services aimed at open, non-discriminatory and efficient procurement through transparent
procedures. The Procurement Policy Division, Department of Expenditure, MoF, has vide
Office Memorandum no: 10/3/2012-PPC dated January 9, 2014 93 prescribed mandatory
publishing of tenders through the e-procurement mode for tenders valued above Rupees two
lakh.

2.0

Service Provider:

A service provider is engaged to provide an e-procurement system covering the following:
i)

All steps involved, starting from hosting of tenders to determination of technocommercially acceptable lowest bidder, are covered;
ii)
The system archives the information and generates reports required for the
management information system/decision support system;
iii)
A helpdesk is available for online and offline support to different stakeholders;
iv)
The system arranges and updates the Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) for
Departmental users; and
v)
Different documents, formats, and so on, for the e-procurement systems are
available.
3.0
Process:
In e-procurement, all processes of tendering have the same content as in normal tendering
and are executed, once the necessary changes have been made, online by using the DSC
as follows:

i)

Communications: Wherever traditional procedures refer to written
communication and documents, the corresponding process in e-procurement
would be handled either fully online by way of uploading/downloading/emails or
automatically generated SMSs or else partly online and partly offline submission.
It is advisable to move to full submissions online. More details would be available
from e-procurement service provider’s portal. In e-procurement, the tender fee,
EMD and documents supporting exemption from such payments are submitted in
paper form to the authority nominated in the NIT, but scanned copies are to be
uploaded – without which the bid may not get opened. In future, such payments
may be allowed online also;

08.4.pdf

253

ii)

Publishing of tenders: Tenders are published on the e-procurement portal by
authorised executives of Procuring Entity with DSC. After the creation of the
tender, a unique "tender id" is automatically generated by the system. While
creating/publishing the tender, the "bid openers" are identified – four officers (two
from the procuring entity and two from the associated/integrated Finance) with a
provision that tenders may be opened by any two of the four officers. The
downloading of the tender may start immediately after e-publication of NIT and
can continue till the last date and time of bid submission. The bid submission will
start from the next day of e-publication of NIT. In case of limited and PAC/ single
tenders, information should also be sent to target vendors/contractors through
SMS/email by the portal;

iii)

Registration of bidders on portal: In order to submit the bid, bidders have to
register themselves online, as a one-time activity, on the e-procurement portal
with a valid DSC. The registration should be in the name of the bidder, whereas
DSC holder may be either the bidder himself or a duly authorised person. The
bidders will have to accept, unconditionally, the online user portal agreement
which contains all the terms and conditions of NIT including commercial and
general terms and conditions and other conditions, if any, along with an online
undertaking in support of the authenticity of the declarations regarding facts,
figures, information and documents furnished by the bidder online;

iv)

Bid submission: The bidders will submit their techno-commercial bids and price
bids online. No conditional bid shall be allowed/ accepted. Bidders will have to
upload scanned copies of various documents required for eligibility and all other
documents as specified in NIT, techno-commercial bid in cover-I, and price bid in
cover-II. To enable system generated techno-commercial and price comparative
statements, such statements should be asked to be submitted in Excel formats.
The bidder will have to give an undertaking online that if the
information/declaration/scanned documents furnished in respect of eligibility
criteria are found to be wrong or misleading at any stage, they will be liable to
punitive action. EMD and tender fee (demand draft/banker’s cheque/pay order)
shall be submitted in the electronic format online (by scanning) while uploading
the bid. This submission shall mean that EMD and tender fee are received
electronically. However, for the purpose of realisation, the bidder shall send the
demand draft/banker’s cheque/pay order in original to the designated officer
through post or by hand so as to reach by the time of tender opening. In case of
exemption of EMD, the scanned copy of the document in support of exemption
will have to be uploaded by the bidder during bid submission;

v)

Corrigendum, clarifications, modifications and withdrawal of bids: All these
steps are also carried out online mutatis mutandis the normal tendering process;

vi)

Bid opening: Both the techno-commercial and price bids are opened online by
the bid openers mentioned at the time of creation of the tender online. Relevant
bidders can simultaneously take part in bid opening online and can see the
resultant bids of all bidders. The system automatically generates a technical
scrutiny report and commercial scrutiny report in case of the techno-commercial
bid opening and a price comparative statement in case of price bid opening which
can also be seen by participating bidders online. Bid openers download the bids

254

and the reports/statements and sign them for further processing. In case of
opening of the price bid, the date and time of opening is uploaded on the portal
and shortlisted firms are also informed through system generated emails and
SMS alerts – after shortlisting of the techno-commercially acceptable bidders;

vii)

Shortfall document: Any document not enclosed by the bidder can be asked for,
as in case of the traditional tender, by the purchaser and submitted by the bidder
online, provided it does not vitiate the tendering process;

viii)

Evaluation of techno-commercial and price bids: This is done offline in the
same manner as in the normal tendering process, based on system generated
reports and comparative statements;

ix)

Award of contract: Award of the contract is done offline and a scanned copy is
uploaded on the portal. More needs to be done in this regard. The information and
the manner of disclosure in this regard must conform to Section 4(1) (b), 4(2) and
4(3) of the RTI Act to enhance transparency and also to reduce the need for filing
individual RTI applications. Therefore, the award must be published in a
searchable format and be linked to its NIT; and

x)

Return of EMD: EMD furnished by all unsuccessful bidders should be returned
through an e-payment system without interest, at the earliest, after the expiry of
the final tender validity period but not later than 30 (thirty) days after conclusion of
the contract. EMD of the successful bidder should be returned after receipt of
performance security as called for in the contract.

4.0 Disposal through e-Auction
4.1
Contractual Legal Aspects of Auction Sale of Scrap
Ministry/ Departments should decide the calendar for holding auctions/ tenders for groups of
lots. A brief summary of this Auction Schedule is given publicity in Newspapers and on
websites, indicating how to obtain/ download Auction Catalogues. For each Auction a
Catalogue is prepared containing details of Schedule of Lots in the Auction, as well as
General and Special Terms and Conditions of Sale (GTC and STC). In contractual terms,
Publishing of an Auction catalogue in sale of scrap is equivalent to NIT/ SBD in Tenders for
procurement and forms the basis of bids by the purchasers. In e-Auction, the General
Conditions of Sale are available on the website and Special Conditions of Sale of each lot is
hyperlinked to the Lot Description. In case of Tender/ Physical Auctions Catalogue contains
these in printed format.
In Auction, the bidders keep bidding higher and the highest accepted bid is accepted. In
such a case a Bid-Sheet is immediately signed by the Seller and Bidder’s representative,
which along with the delivery order serves as a legal contract document. In e-Auction, Bid
Sheet is generated with DSCs of Buyer and Seller.
4.2
Legal Status of e-Auction
e-Auction through E- Auction Service Provider (eASP) is a triangular contract. eASP is a
sub-agent of the seller through a standing contract entered between them, which is subject
to general terms and conditions (GTC) of eASP. eASP is also a sub-agent of the successful
buyer through a standing contract between them which is subject to Buyer Specific Terms
and Conditions (BSTC). eASP gets a commission of fixed percentage of sale value from the
purchaser directly – which is deducted from the amount payable to the seller. The e-auction

255

sale is governed by GTC, BSTC and Special Terms and& Conditions (STC) of the e-auction.
In case of conflict or differences among any provisions of GTC, BSTC and STC, the
provisions of STC would prevail. Normally, successful purchasers pay all monies to eASP
who, in turn, transfers it to the seller. But the seller may, if desired, negotiate with eASP to
accept such payments directly from purchaser.
4.3
Creating an Auction Event: Auction Catalogue
The seller lists items to be auctioned on a specified date. This list is generally called an
auction catalogue. Besides the list of items, it also contains any special conditions of
contract applicable generally or to specific lots. The following auction details are provided in
this list: Auction Catalogue.
i) Auction number;
ii) Auction Opening date and time,
iii) Auction Closing date and time;
iv) Type of Auction Ending: Close Ended/ Open Ended
v) Max Auto Extensions Allowed (five to ten)/ Duration of Auto Extensions (90
Secs– ninety seconds)
vi) Auction Catalogue Number and Date
vii) Inspection from date;
viii) Inspection closing date;
ix) Seller/Unit name;
x) Address; Contact details;
xi) Details of the contact person;
xii) Details of ED and Sales Tax (CST/ VAT) in each Lot and TCS (including
Surcharge and Edu Cess) for all lots;
xiii) Whether Subject to Acceptance (STA) is applicable for bids within (10% (ten
percent) or any other percentage) of the Reserve Price and
xiv) List of lots to be included:(Lot Description is hyper-linked to relevant details
containing special terms of lifting, etc)
The fixed reserve price also has to be uploaded on the portal for each lot, which is kept

confidential. It should also be mentioned if bids below the reserve price up to a percentage
can be accepted on an STA basis. The auction details can be posted by eASP but to
maintain the sanctity of the reserve price, it is better for the seller to do so through his login
and password. The bidder's queries before the auction will reach seller by e-mail and can
be answered online. The seller will not be allowed to edit any item once the auction starts.
To attract bidders to the auction to get a higher price, the seller should describe items in
detail to include information such as condition and size of the item. The more information is
provided, the more bidders will bid with confidence. A photo can also be uploaded.
Generally, auctions with images have higher sell-through. Many buyers like to browse

256

through the eASP categories and, therefore, listing the item in the appropriate category
increases the likelihood of interested bidders viewing it.
4.4
Buyer Eligibility
All prospective e-auction sellers and bidders will have to register themselves by filling in the
relevant details online. Bidders have also to pay the specified non-refundable registration fee
(usually Rs.10,000 – Rupees ten thousand) off line. Only registered bidders will be able to
access the auction floor. The auction notification will, however, be seen by all internet users.
If it is found that the bidder is not adhering to the terms and conditions of the e-auction and
also indulging in any malpractices either himself or through his agents, deputies or observer,
such a bidder is liable to be blacklisted and appropriate action will be taken as deemed fit by
the seller. There are various reports available by which seller can rate a bidder. The seller
can restrict or blacklist a buyer from bidding by making a formal request to eASP.
4.5
Conduct of Auction
The seller cannot close/cancel an auction once it starts. It can be cancelled/ amended prior
to the starting of the auction by making a request for cancellation. The following information
will be present on the auction floor web-page:

i) Opening date and time,
ii) Closing date and time,
iii) Item number,
iv) Item name, hyper-linked to relevant details containing duties, etc., /special terms of
lifting, etc.;

v) Quantity and unit of measurement;
vi) Location of material/item;
vii) Last bid or basic price, if any;
viii)Bidders’ bid in Rs./unit; and
ix) Bid history.
The closing time of an auction shall automatically be extended by period indicated in Auction
Catalogue for all auctions if bid continues (e.g., in case the closing time is 5.30 pm of any
particular date and if a bidder bids at 5.29 pm then the closing time will be automatically
extended). Maximum number of auto extensions are also specified.
Bidders are able to indicate the bid price through their login. A bid, once given, cannot be
retracted. Conditional offers will not be accepted/entertained. Each bidder will have the
option to declare his maximum value of bid (which cannot be viewed by other bidders) up to
which his automatic bidding will continue.
The seller can monitor auction activity and view the bidding history of the live auctions,
reserve prices (reserve price can only be viewed by seller and no one else), and other
features. However, the seller will get an automated email once the auction ends with detailed
information on the auction (highest bidder, subject to approval items, rejected items).

257

The respective items will be marked "sold" after closing of the auction when the highest bid
is greater than the reserve price and an automatic intimation to the concerned buyer will be
sent online to make the payment.
If the bid price matches the limits specified for inclusion in STA, then it shall be shown under
the STA category and the seller will be accordingly informed. In case of STA, the seller has
to convey the acceptability of the bid amount or otherwise of the bid value to eASP as well
as the bidder within three days (excluding holidays) of the close of the auction.
In case of “Sold” or STA a Bid-Sheet is displayed (Annexure 20), indicating the details of the
accepted bid, which is printed and shows digital signatures of Auction Supervising Officer
and the Bidder. As mentioned before this serves the role of legal Contract document.
If the reserve price has not been met by close of auction, the auction closes without a
winning bidder. On the seller’s request, eASP will arrange for inclusion of the unsold item in
the next auction.
4.6
Earnest Money Deposit
EMD is payable within seven calendar days from the date of closing of the e-auction
(excluding the date of closing) by the successful bidder. EMD is equivalent to 25 per cent of
material value of the accepted lots and 10 (ten) per cent of the material value for STA lots in
the forms of a demand draft drawn in favour of the authority mentioned in the auction
catalogue. On receipt of the EMD by eASP, an acceptance letter/sale order will be issued for
sold lots. In case of failure to pay the EMD in time, the login of the party will be deactivated
in addition to other actions as deemed fit and the offer will stand withdrawn.
4.7
Payment of Balance Sale Value (BSV)
In case of sold/accepted lots and lots taken on STA basis, the balance payment has to be
made within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the date of the acceptance letter/sale order
(excluding the date of issue of the acceptance letter/sale order), by way of a demand draft as
per the following manner:
i) Commission percentage as per STC/ GTC/ BSTC to be paid in favour of
eASP, by way of demand draft/pay order;
ii) The balance amount (after deducting the EMD and amount payable to eASP)
plus applicable VAT/duties, income tax and other charges if any must be paid
in favour of authority mentioned in auction catalogue;
iii) In case of delay, a late payment charge @ one per cent per week or part
thereof will be charged up to two weeks only and thereafter the EMD will
stand forfeited without any notice; and
iv) Tax Collected at Source (TCS) at the applicable percentage (presently@ one
per cent) of the gross value (material value + excise duty + VAT + any other
applicable taxes/duties/cess, etc.) may be deducted by the purchaser and a
TDS certificate may be given. A surcharge of 10% (ten percent) on TCS and
a further Education cess of 3% (three percent) is leviable on the TCS+
Surcharge.
4.8
Delivery Order
eASP will hand over, to the successful buyer, a delivery order authorising the Stores
Department to make such a delivery, after getting the requisite material value. The

258

purchaser will approach the seller with the delivery order to allow him to lift the material. The

(Columns 1 to). Information pertaining to S.No. ix) (Columns 9) shall be filled by the store
keeper.

259

Appendix 4: Management of Public Procurement Function
1.0

Organisation of Procurement Function

The procurement function should be so organised that procurement executives get an
opportunity to develop expertise in a particular market segment, and internal customers may
have to deal with only a single point of interface. Thus, work distribution in the procurement
entity may be segmented based on markets, but there may be nodal officers to provide a
single window interface to internal clients.
In a procurement entity, beside procurement activities, there are also ancillary activities. In a
small procurement entity, these ancillary activities may be distributed among various
executives. Ancillary procurement activities are:
i) Administration and management services;
ii) Human resources development and training;
iii) Policy and guidelines;
iv) Procurement performance measurement and management reporting
v) IT systems and master data management;
vi) Advertising, bidding document sale/ issue/receipt, tender boxes, tender opening, custody
of samples;
vii) Direct contracting/local purchase;
viii) Liaison and progressing;
ix) Supplier relations management and registration; and
x) Legal and arbitration matters.

2.0

Management Reporting

2.1

Procurement Key Performance Indices and Management Reporting

As in all management and financial functions, it is possible to measure the pulse of the
procurement function by using certain Procurement Key Performance Indices (KPIs). As part
of management reporting, these KPIs can be devised to reflect the status of workload,
throughput and efficiency of the procurement function. Some KPIs are given in Appendix 5:
Templates for Management Reports and KPIs.

2.2

Management Reports for Monitoring of Procurement Function

For proper monitoring and control of the procurement function, regular monthly reports to
procurement managers should highlight throughput and stagnation at important milestones
of the procurement process. The milestones where workload, throughput and stagnation
need to be studied in procurement management are:

i) Receipt of indent;
ii) Issue of tenders;
iii) Finalisation of tender decision;
iv) Signing of contracts;

260

v) Successful performance of the contract; and
vi) Payments for supplies/works/services.
This will highlight stages where urgent intervention is required for efficient procurement to
the management. These reports would be compiled by the procuring entity. Templates for
management reports are given in Appendix 5: Templates for Management Reports and
KPIs.

3.0

Record Keeping

3.1
All procurements done by the organisation are subject to post audit by internal audit,
statutory audit and various internal and external vigilance agencies. Hence, all documents
related to the procurement should be filed and kept systematically and safely. Files shall be
properly numbered on the notes and correspondence side. The period of retention of various
types of documents should be laid down. The procuring entity should also maintain following
basic records (either in manual or electronic form):
i)

Item/Asset Master Database: The heart of the procurement system is the item/asset
master database. It contains complete data about an item or asset handled in the past. It
contains: code-number; category; description long/short; specification; drawings; trade
group of vendors; book-rate; estimated annual consumption; replenishment data;
inventory parameters (buffer stock, safety stock levels) – to the extent relevant to goods,
works or services;

ii) Vendor/Contractors Database: Contains vendor/contractor information such as name;
address ; small scale and minority enterprise categorisation; registration data
(registration code, trade groups, monetary limits of registration, NSIC registrations); past
performance ratings;
iii) Procurement Register: Key information at various stages of procurement operations,
from receipt of indents till the issue of the contract, is recorded (manually or
electronically) in the procurement register. The Procurement register thus enables
ascertaining of status of a particular procurement and also overall monitoring of
efficiency and throughput of procurement operations;
iv) Procurement Order Guard Register: An indexed register with only machine numbered
stubs of pages (instead of full pages) is used for this purpose. One ink signed copy of all
orders issued by the procuring entity is compulsorily pasted in these stubs in
chronological order. This is the most authentic record which is used as a guard and
ultimate reference against any tampering/falsification/misreporting of procurement
orders; and
v) Procurement Order Progress Register: It contains record of all procurement orders
issued and progress of supplies against these contracts. It contains procurement order
numbers, vendor/contractor name, brief description of procurement, total value of the
order, delivery dates, actual dates of supply, and so on.

FOREWORD
1.

Government organizations procure a wide variety of goods and services and undertake
execution of works in pursuance of their duties and responsibilities. With a view to
improving transparency in decision making in public procurement and reducing the
scope for subjectivity, Department of Expenditure in 2006 had prepared a set of three
Manuals on Policies and Procedures for Procurement of Goods, Works and hiring of
Consultants, in conformity with the General Financial Rules (GFR), 2005. Over the years,
these Manuals have served as a guide book for procurement.

2.

In the last few years, the Government of India has issued new instructions in the domain
of public procurement. Some of these important changes include introduction of Central
Public Procurement Portal (CPPP), preference for domestic contractors, inclusion of integrity
pact, etc. The GFR has been revised comprehensively in March 2017 covering inter-alia
these set of new instructions. Consequently, the Manual of Procurement of Goods and
Manual for Procurement of Consultancy & Other Services too have been revised.

3.

The new Manual on Procurement of Works has been extensively revised in keeping with
GFR 2017 and in consonance with the fundamental principles of transparency, fairness,
competition, economy, efficiency and accountability. Efforts have been made to cover
all major aspects of procurement in this Manual in a user-friendly manner. The manual
is the outcome of extensive consultations with Ministries/ Departments/ PSUs and other
organizations over a period of more than one year.

4.

Manuals issued by this Department are to be taken as generic guidelines, which have
to be necessarily broad in nature. Ministries/ Departments are advised to supplement
this manual to suit their local/ specialized needs, by issuing their own detailed
manuals (including customized formats); Standard Bidding Documents and Schedule of
Procurement Powers to serve as detailed instructions for their own procuring officers.

5.

I would like to acknowledge the efforts taken by Shri Sanjay Prasad, Joint Secretary
(PF C-II), Shri Sanjay Aggarwal, Director (PPD), Shri Kotluru Narayana Reddy, Deputy
Secretary (PPD) and Shri Girish Bhatnagar, Consultant (Public Procurement) in revision of
this Manual. I would also like to thank the Ministries, Departments, other organisations
and individuals who reviewed the drafts of the Manual and provided their valuable
inputs.

6.

I hope that this Manual would be useful to procuring officials working in various Ministries/
Departments as operating instructions and will bring about greater transparency and
predictability in government procedures and help in improving the ease of doing business
with the Government.

Secretary (Expenditure)

Chapter 1: Introduction to Procurement of Works
1.1

Procurement Rules and Regulations; and this Manual

i)

Various ministries, departments, attached and subordinate offices, local urban bodies,
public sector enterprises and other government (including autonomous) bodies
(hereinafter referred as ‘Procuring Entities’) spend a sizeable amount of their budget
on procurement of goods, works and services to discharge the duties and
responsibilities assigned to them.

ii)

The Ministries/ Departments have been delegated powers to make their own
arrangements for procurement of works under the Delegation of Financial Power
Rules, which have to be exercised in conformity with the ‘Procurement Guidelines’.

iii) To ensure that these procurements are made by following a uniform, systematic,
efficient and cost-effective procedure and also to ensure fair and equitable treatment
of bidders/ contractors, there are statutory provisions; rules; financial, vigilance,
security, safety, counter- trade and other regulations; orders and guidelines of the
Government on the subject of public procurement (hereinafter referred as
‘Procurement Guidelines’) which provide framework for the public procurement
system.
iv) At the apex of the statutory framework governing public procurement is Article 299 of
the Constitution of India, which stipulates that contracts legally binding on the
Government have to be executed in writing by officers specifically authorized to do so.
The Constitution also enshrines Fundamental Rights (In particular Article 14 – Right to
Equality before law and Article 19 (1) (g) – Right to carry on a Profession) which have
implications for Public Procurement. Further, the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (as amended in 2015) are major legislations
governing contracts for procurement (both private and public) in general. There are in
addition guidelines issued by Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) relating to
Governance issues which are applicable to Public Procurement also. There is no law
exclusively governing public procurement.
v)

However, comprehensive Rules and Regulations in this regard are available in the
General Financial Rules (GFR), 2017, Delegation of Financial Powers Rules (DFPR);
Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India), Order 2017 and the guidelines
issued by the Central Vigilance Commission to increase transparency and objectivity
in public procurement.

vi) Without purporting to be a comprehensive compendium of all such ‘Procurement
Guidelines’, this Manual is intended to serve as a portal to enter this vast area and
draw attention to basic norms and practices governing public procurement.
These guidelines would not be applicable to projects funded by World Bank and other
International Funding Agencies, as, such external aid/ loans etc. received are covered under
the applicable policies/ legal agreements executed as permitted under Rules 264 of GFR
2017.

quantity subject to the Class-I local supplier’s quoted price falling within the
margin of purchase preference, and contract for that quantity shall be awarded
to such ‘Class-I local supplier’ subject to matching the L1 price. In case such

than the offered quantity, the next higher ‘Class-I local supplier’ within the
margin of purchase preference shall be invited to match the L1 price for
remaining quantity and so on, and contract shall be awarded accordingly. In

supplier’ as well as ‘Non-local supplier’, as per following procedure:
a)

In case there is sufficient local capacity and competition for the item to be procured, as

of contract so as to ensure that the ‘Class I Local suppliers’ taken in totality are considered

whose quoted rates fall within 20 (twenty) percent margin of purchase preference, subject
to its meeting the prescribed criteria for award of contract as also the constraint of
maximum quantity that can be sourced from any single supplier. If the lowest quoting
‘Class-I local supplier’, does not qualify for purchase preference because of aforesaid
constraints or does not accept the offered quantity, an opportunity may be given to next
higher ‘Class-I local supplier’, falling within 20 (twenty) percent margin of purchase
preference, and so on.

shall enter into a joint venture with an Indian company to participate in the tender.
Procuring entities, while procuring such items beyond the notified threshold value, shall
prescribe in their respective tenders that foreign companies may enter into a joint
venture with an Indian company to participate in the tender. The procuring

Clarification, Amendments and Revision of this Manual

For revision, interpretation, clarification and issues relating to this manual, the Procurement
Policy Division, Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance would be the nodal authority.

1.3
i)

Applicability of this Manual
Works: This manual is applicable to procurement of Works is defined as “any activity,
sufficient in itself to fulfil an economic or technical function, involving construction,
fabrication, repair, overhaul, renovation, decoration, installation, erection, excavation,
dredging, and so on, which make use of a combination of one or more of engineering
design, architectural design, material and technology, labour, machinery and
equipment. Supply of some materials or certain services may be incidental or
consequential to and part of such works. The term “Works” includes (i) civil works for
the purposes of roads, railway, airports, shipping-ports, bridges, buildings, irrigation
systems, water supply, sewerage facilities, dams, tunnels and earthworks; and so on,
and (ii) mechanical and electrical works involving fabrication, installation, erection,
repair and maintenance of a mechanical or electrical nature relating to machinery and
plants”.

8

ii) Classification of Works: The civil works are classified in GFR 2017 (Rule 130) into
three categories: (a) Original Works (b) Minor Works and (c) Repairs Works. “Original
works” means all new constructions, site preparation, additions and alterations to
existing works. It also includes special repairs to newly purchased or previously
abandoned buildings or structures, including remodelling or replacement. “Minor
works” mean works which add capital value to existing assets but do not create new
assets. “Repair works” means works undertaken to maintain building and fixtures.
Expenditure on Repair Work does not add to the value of the asset and only restores
the functionality of the asset. Repair Work can be further categorized as (i) Annual
repairs covering routine and yearly operation and maintenance work on buildings and
services (ii) Special repairs, which are undertaken as and when required, covering
major repairs to existing buildings or services. Some types of the Special repairs may
qualify to be categorised as ‘Original Work’ as mentioned earlier.
iii) Procurement Entities
Procurement Entities which can benefit from this manual include ministries,
departments, or a unit thereof, or an attached or subordinate offices/ units; any other
body (including autonomous bodies) substantially owned or controlled by or receiving
substantial financial assistance from the Central Government. It can still be utilised, if
these procurement entities outsource the procurement process or bundle the
procurement process with other contractual arrangements or utilise the services of
procurement support agency or procurement agents to carry out the procurement on
their behalf. But these procurement guidelines would not apply to procurements by
these procuring entities for their own use from their subsidiary companies including
Joint Ventures in which they have controlling share.
Major Works procuring Ministries/ Departments like the Central Public Works
Department (CPWD); Military Engineering Service (MES); Border Roads Organisation
(BRO); Ministries of Railways; Information & Broadcasting and Departments of Posts,
and Space etc. already have their own detailed guidelines tailored to unique individual
requirements, e.g. Manuals or Procedure Orders, which will continue to be applicable
to these organizations.
This manual for procurement of works is more specifically addressed to those
Ministries/ Departments and their attached and subordinate offices, as well as
autonomous bodies (except to the extent the bye laws of an autonomous body provides
for different provisions, which have been approved by the Government) which don’t
have in-house capabilities to execute Works and assign most of the procurement of
works to third parties (Public Works Organisations or PSUs).
This Manual is also useful for directly execution of repair works by these agencies up
to 6Rs. thirty lakh.
iv) For procurements financed by Loans/ Grants extended by International Agencies: The
Articles of Agreement with the International Agencies like the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank etc. stipulate specific procurement procedures to be followed by
the borrowers. The procurement procedures, as finalized and incorporated in the

Agreements after consideration and approval of the Ministry of Finance are to be
followed accordingly.

1.4

Basic Aims of Procurement – Five R’s of Procurement

In every procurement, public or private, the basic aim is to achieve just the right balance
between costs and requirements concerning five parameters called the five R’s of
procurement. The entire process of procurement (from the time that need for an item, facility
or services is identified till the need is satisfied) is designed to achieve following basic aims.
Although couched in jargon of procurement of Goods, it’s equally applicable to procurement
of Works. The term ‘Right’ is used here in the sense of being optimal:
i)

Right quality;

ii)

Right quantity;

iii) Right price;
iv) Right time and place; and
v)

Right source.

(For more details on basic aims of procurement, please refer to Chapter 1 of the Manual for
Procurement of Goods 2017 – reproduced in Appendix 1. Please refer to Broader obligation
principle under Appendix 1 for instructions related to registration of bidders belonging to
countries sharing land border with India, and Annexure-13).

1.5

Fundamental Principles of Public Procurement

Over and above the basic aims of procurement, the obligations of procuring authorities can
be grouped into following five fundamental principles of public procurement, which all
procuring authorities must abide by and be accountable for:
i)

Transparency principle;

ii)

Professionalism principle;

iii) Broader obligations principle;
iv) Extended legal principle; and
v)

Public accountability principle.

(For more details on basic aims of procurement, please refer to Chapter 1 of the Manual for
Procurement of Goods-reproduced in Appendix 1).

1.6

Standards (Canons) of Financial Propriety

Public Procurement like any other expenditure in Government must conform to the Standards
(also called Canons) of Financial Propriety. It may be useful to refer to the relevant provisions
in the General Financial Rules, 2017
“Rule 21. Standards of financial propriety: Every officer incurring or authorizing expenditure
from public moneys should be guided by high standards of financial propriety. Every officer
should also enforce financial order and strict economy and see that all relevant financial rules
and regulations are observed, by his own office and by subordinate disbursing officers. Among
the principles on which emphasis is generally laid are the following:-

10

i)

Every officer is expected to exercise the same vigilance in respect of expenditure
incurred from public moneys as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in
respect of expenditure of his own money.

ii)

The expenditure should not be prima facie more than the occasion demands.

iii) No authority should exercise its powers of sanctioning expenditure to pass an order
which will be directly or indirectly to its own advantage.
iv) Expenditure from public moneys should not be incurred for the benefit of a particular
person or a section of the people, unless i)

a claim for the amount could be enforced in a Court of Law, or

ii) The expenditure is in pursuance of a recognized policy or custom.
The amount of allowances granted to meet expenditure of a particular type should be so
regulated that the allowances are not on the whole a source of profit to the recipients.”

1.7
i)

Public Procurement Infrastructure at the Centre
Procurement Policy Division

Procurement Policy Division (PPD) in Department of Expenditure; Ministry of Finance has
been created to encourage uniformity and harmonisation in public procurement processes
by setting guidelines, dissemination of best practices, providing guidance, oversight and
capacity building and issuing of procurement manuals. However, Centralisation of
procurement or involvement in procurement processes is not the intended purpose of
creation of PPD.
ii)

Central Public Procurement Portal

Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) has been designed, developed and hosted by
National Informatics Centre (NIC, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology) in
association with Dept. of Expenditure to ensure transparency in the public procurement
process. The primary objective of the Central Public Procurement portal is to provide a
single point access to the information on procurements made across various Ministries and
the Departments. The CPPP has e-publishing and e-procurement modules. It is mandatory
for all Ministries/ Departments of the Central Government, Central Public Sector
Enterprises (CPSEs) and Autonomous and Statutory Bodies to publish on the CPPP all
their tender enquiries and information about the resulting contracts. CPPP provides access
to information such as documents relating to pre-qualification, Bidders’ enlistment, Bidding
documents; details of bidders, their pre-qualification, enlistment, exclusions/ debarments;
decisions taken regarding prequalification and selection of successful bid. GFR 2017 (Rule
160) makes it mandatory for Ministries/ Departments to receive all bids through eprocurement portals in respect of all procurements. Ministries/ Departments which do not
have a large volume of procurement or carry out procurements required only for day-to-day
running of offices and also have not initiated e-procurement through any other solution
provided so far, may use e-procurement solution (CPPP) developed by NIC. Other
Ministries/ Departments may either use e-procurement solution developed by NIC or
engage any other service provider following due process. In the latter case, data on tenders
are to be published on CPPP as well through web-service.
iii) Government e-Marketplace (GeM)

11

To ensure better transparency and higher efficiency an online Government e-Marketplace
(GeM– an e-commerce marketplace) has been developed for common use goods and
services. In GeM product or services are offered by a number of eligible sellers and all the
eligible buyers can view/ compare all the product/ services and select the product/ services
offered by any one of the seller. In general, because online marketplaces aggregate
product/ services from a wide array of providers, selection is usually wider, availability is
higher, and prices are more competitive than in vendor-specific online retail stores. The
procurement process on GeM is online and electronic - end to end from placement of supply
order to payment to suppliers. The registration of suppliers on GeM is online and automatic
based on ID authentication etc. The procuring authorities have to assess the reasonability
of rates. Buyer’s transactions are processed by the GeM portal and then product/ services
are delivered and fulfilled directly by the participating sellers. Tools of reverse bidding and
e-auction are also available which can be utilised for the procurement of bulk quantities.
More details are available in Rule 149, GFR, 2017. The Procurement of Goods and
Services by Ministries or Departments are mandatory for Goods or Services available on
GeM. Ministries/ Departments are expected to work with GeM in making available on the
GeM platform as many products/ services by making available such Goods and Services
which are regularly procured by them.

1.8

Legal Aspects Governing Public Procurement of Works

A public procurement contract, besides being a commercial transaction, is also a legal
transaction. There are a number of laws that may affect various commercial aspects of public
procurement contracts. A public procurement professional is expected to be generally aware
of the implications of following basic laws affecting procurement of works; however, he or she
is not expected to be a legal expert. In different contexts of the scope of work, an additional
set of laws may be relevant.
i)

The Constitution of India;

ii)

Indian Contracts Act, 1872;

iii)

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read with The Arbitration and Conciliation
(Amendment) Act, 2015;

iv)

Competition Act, 2002 as amended with Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007;

v)

The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act, regarding e-procurement and e-auction,
popularly called the Cyber Law);

vi)

Right to Information (RTI) Act 2005;

vii)

Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003;

viii)

Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (DSPE – basis of the Central Bureau of
Investigation);

ix)

Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988;

x)

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Sections 195(1) and 197(1));

xi)

Various labour laws applicable at the works’ site;

xii)

Various building and safety acts, codes, standards applicable in the context of the
scope of work; and

12

xiii)

Various environmental and mining laws, codes, standards applicable in the context of
the scope of work.

(For salient features of laws applicable to public procurement, please refer to Appendix 2).

1.9

The Law of Agency – applicable to Procurement of Works

In addition to Laws which are applicable to Public Procurement of Works mentioned above,
the Law of Agency (Section 182 to section 238, of the Indian Contract Act, 1872) implies that
Contractor would be an Agent of the Procuring Entity, to execute the works on its behalf.
Hence, there exists a Principal/ Employer and Agent relationship between Procuring Entity
and such Contractor. As per this law, the employer is vicariously legally and financially liable
for actions of its Agents. For example, a violation of certain labour laws in deputing staff for
Procuring Entity’s contract by the agents may render the Procuring Entity legally and
financially liable for such violations, under certain circumstances. The Procuring Entities need
to be aware of such eventualities. Standard Bidding Documents should take care of this
aspect.

1.10
i)

The Basic Principles of undertaking works:
No new works should be sanctioned without
i) Careful assessment of the assets or facilities already available and time and
cost required to complete the new works.
ii) A concept plan/ preliminary drawing have been approved by the Authority
competent to accord sanction. While designing projects to the extent possible,
principles of Life Cycle Costing may also be considered;

ii)

As budgetary resources are limited and granted on annual basis, adequate provisions
should be ensured for works and services already in progress before new works are
undertaken.

iii) No project or work will be split up to bring it within the sanctioning powers of a lower
authority.
iv)

7
8

7

For purpose of approval and sanctions, a group of works which forms one project,
shall be considered as one work. The approval or sanction of the higher authority for
such a project which consists of such a group of work should not be circumvented by
resorting to approval of individual works using the powers of approval or sanction of a
lower authority. 8If the component parts of a project are mutually independent of each
other and are not dependent on the execution of one or more such component parts,
each such part should be treated as a separate project. In case the functioning of a
project is dependent on the execution of one or more other projects, the entire group
of such projects should be taken as a single scheme/ project and provision made
accordingly. If however, a scheme consists of revenue component, capital expenditure
and loan content, etc. the provision for which is required to be exhibited separately
under respective Heads of Account, there is no objection to the provision being made
in the relevant Heads of Account; but the authorities concerned should ensure that the
sanction of the Competent Authority is obtained for the integrated scheme as a whole

Rule 137, GFR, 2017
MoF OM No. F.1(26)-E-II(A)/66 dtd 04/01/1967 & 27/10/1967

13

depending on the total cost of the scheme. It will not be permissible in such cases to
split up a scheme treating each part as a scheme in order to avoid the sanction of a
higher authority.
9

v)

Any anticipated or actual savings from a sanctioned estimate for a definite project,
shall not, without special authorisation, be applied to carry out additional work not
contemplated in the original project.

vi)

10

Any development of a project considered necessary while a work is in progress,
which is not contingent on the execution of work first sanctioned, shall have to be
covered by a supplementary estimate.

vii) The construction period and sanctioned cost stipulated in the sanction of Project will
not be exceeded as far as possible.
viii) 11Ministry or Department shall put in place, as far as possible, empowered project
teams for all large value projects and these teams should be tasked only with project
execution and not given other operational duties.
ix) The competent financial authority according administrative approval should be kept
informed of the physical and financial progress of the work till their completion through
regular periodical reports.
12

x)

Subject to the observance of these general rules (Rule 130 – 141, GFR, 2017), the
initiation, authorization, procurement and execution of works allotted to a particular
Ministry or Department shall be regulated by detailed rules and orders contained in the
respective departmental regulations and by other special orders applicable to them.
The detailed procedure relating to expenditure on such works shall be prescribed by
departmental regulations framed in consultation with the Accounts Officer, generally
based on the procedures and the principles underlying the financial and accounting
rules prescribed for similar works carried out by the Central Public Works Department
(CPWD).

xi)

13

No works shall be commenced or liability incurred in connection with it until:-

i)
Feasibility Study Report / Preliminary Project Report (PPR) has been be
prepared in case of works of substantial value
ii)
A proper Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been prepared by a competent
agency;
iii)
Administrative approval (A/A) has been obtained from the appropriate
authority, in each case;
iv)
Expenditure Sanction (E/S) to incur expenditure has been obtained from the
competent authority;
v)
Technical approval has been obtained of the detailed and coordinated design
of all the Architectural, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Horticulture and any other

services included in the scope of the sanction and of the Detailed Cost Estimates
containing the detailed specifications and quantities of various items prepared on the
basis of the schedule of rates maintained by CPWD or other Public Works
Organizations.
vi)
Funds to cover the work, which will be executed, at least during the current
year, have been provided by competent authority.
vii) Tenders have been invited and processed in accordance with rules.
viii) Award of work and execution of Contract Agreement;
ix) A work order has been issued.
x) Time taken in grant of statutory and other clearances also contributes to the time
and cost overrun in public projects. These clearances are required to achieve
specific objectives like concern for the environment, aviation safety, preservation
of national heritage, conservation of forest and wildlife etc. Public Authorities/
Project Executing Authorities should plan for obtaining all necessary clearances
quickly and proper efforts be made for the same, which also should be duly
recorded. The progress regarding follow up of obtaining the statutory clearances
should be closely monitored.
xi) The process of land acquisition shall be started by the Procuring Entity, well
ahead and completed entirely, or at least substantially, before the work is started.
Availability of auxiliary services has been ensured - like roads/access, power,
water, solid & liquid waste disposal system, street lighting and other civic services
shall be ensured. It is desirable to have 100% of the required land in possession
before award of contract; however, it may not always be possible to have the
entire land due to prevailing circumstances. Also, it may not be prudent to put the
entire process of award of contract on hold for want of the remaining portion of
land, which in the assessment of public authority or the project executing
authority, could possibly be acquired in a targeted manner after award of the
contract, without affecting progress. Minimum necessary encumbrance free land
should be available before award of contract. The minimum may be determined
based on the circumstances of each case or general guidelines, issued by the
concerned authorities. Such land, non-availability of which, will prevent essential
components of work from execution, should be insisted upon. Public Authorities/
Project Executing Authorities should plan for acquiring balance land quickly and
proper efforts be made for the same, which also should be duly recorded. The
progress regarding land acquisition should be closely monitored.

2.1

Perspective Planning for Works

Each Ministry/ Department shall prepare a perspective plan for undertaking different types of
works. There shall also be a provision for annual review of the plan for making modifications,
if any.

2.2

Preparation of Preliminary Project Report (PPR) or Rough Cost Estimate

2.2.1 In case the work is to be executed under its own arrangement by the Ministry/
Department, a preliminary project report (PPR) or Rough Cost Estimate shall be prepared by
the Works Committee based on Land, Site Details, functional and space requirements (or
Various Facilities, Special Requirements/ Features and Broad Specifications for specialised
Equipment and Plants), Layout Plans etc, with the technical details/ documents mentioned
below being prepared by (or under the guidance of) the technical member(s) of the Works

Works Organisation (PWO) or the Public Sector Undertaking (PSU – refer Para 3.1 below),
on requisition from Ministry/ Department for procurement of works, PWO or the PSU to whom
work is entrusted for execution shall prepare such PPR or Rough Cost Estimate and submit it
to the requiring Department/ Ministry. Based on PPR and Rough Cost Estimate, the competent
authority in Administrative Ministry/ Department grants in Principle approval indicating
approval of the concept and scope of the project at the rough cost assessed. Ministry of
Finance (DoE) has issued detailed instructions regarding appraisal and approval of Public
Funded projects/ schemes17.
2.2.2

viii) Rough Cost Estimate: Ministries/Department may carefully assess alternative
technological options, their area requirements and obtain Rough Cost on the basis of
prevailing Plinth Area rates (or any other reliable basis) without preparation of drawings
to enable the competent authority to accord in principle approval.
ix) If relevant, Cost benefits analysis of the project, including evaluation of options for cost
sharing/ recovery (user charges) for infrastructure/ services. Principles of Life Cycle
Cost may also be considered, to the extent feasible.
x)

Cash flow: This will show year-wise requirement.

xi) Source & availability of funds - The manner of transferring the fund to the executing
agency to be spelt out.

xiii) Any other relevant documents.
xiv) A presentation on the findings of the feasibility study/ PPR may be made by a team
(which may include engineers/ consultants/ outside experts, finance officers etc.)
before the public authority/ or designated competent authority. This is to provide an
opportunity to the public authority to have an overall assessment of the situation,
appraisal of various options as well as likely challenges and mitigation measures. In
the case of very large projects, such presentation may be made to the head of the
public authority. The record of discussions during the presentation may become part
of the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and tender file/ project record.

2.3

Acceptance of necessity and issue of in-Principle Approval

Approval of competent financial authority for accepting the necessity of works and its Scope
should be sought on the basis of PPR or Rough Cost Estimate and in Principle Approval of
the concerned Ministry/ Department shall be made available for preparation of Detailed Project
Report or Preliminary Estimates.

2.4

Preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) /Preliminary Estimates (PE)

2.4.1 On receipt of in-Principle Approval of the project, the procuring entity shall finalize the
Detailed Project Report giving reference to the documents mentioned below. The DPR should
provide a level playing field to the bidders and should ensure as far as feasible, the widest
possible competition:

i) Reference to Concept plan/ preliminary drawings and their acceptance - This shall
indicate the details of Concept plan/ preliminary drawings prepared and their approval
by the requisitioning authority;

ii) Details of scope of the project indicating clearly the list of Engineering Services
(Mechanical/ Electrical/ Plumbing) as well as Operation and Maintenance included or
not included in the DPR/PE;

iii) Preliminary estimated cost – This will also include the expected escalation for the
period of completion of the project and also the departmental or lump sum charges to

18

be paid to the executing agency (Public Works Organization or PSUs). Cash flow
projection should show year-wise requirement. While designing the projects etc, if and
to the extent possible, principles of Life Cycle Cost may also be considered;

iv) Time of the completion – This will consist of two parts, one for pre- construction activity
till award of the work and the other one for the execution;
v)

Details of land required along with land plan schedule to implement timely land
acquisition procedures;

vi) Environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project and approval thereof, wherever
applicable;

vii) Social Impact Assessment and Resettlement and Rehabilitation: Social Impact
Assessment needs to be done, based on baseline socio-economic survey and census
survey data, to identify the Project Affected People (PAPs). A Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Plan should be prepared for the PAPs in accordance with the LARR Act
2013 or National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NPRR), and State
Governments framework of resettlement policies and other social safeguard policies
designed to protect the rights of the affected persons and communities as applicable;

viii)List of Approval of Statutory Bodies required;
ix) Annual plan allocation and cash flow;
x) Systems to be adopted for project monitoring;
xi) Works accounting system;
xii) Quality assurance system/ mechanism;
xiii)Bidding Systems - Single, two parts, pre-qualification, Post- qualification.
In case the work is being executed by the Ministry/ Department themselves, DPR and PE will
be prepared by the Ministry/ Department itself. In case the Work is assigned to Public Works
Organisation or the Public Sector Undertaking, that agency shall prepare the DPR and PE.
For repair works costing up to Rs. 30 (thirty) lakh, preparation of DPR and PE may be
dispensed with, since repair work does not need detailed designing. Sanction may be
accorded by the competent authority based on PPR itself.
2.4.2 Major reasons for the problem in works contracts (in particular relating to construction
of roads, highways, ports, runways, dams etc. on item-rate or percentage rate basis) is the
out-sourcing of preparation of Detailed Project Reports to consultants without sufficient
relevant experience or giving them sufficient time to do so. It is therefore essential to stipulate
& ensure successful project design/ supervision experience while selecting consultants,
especially for large works contracts. DPR in such contracts is required to be based on proper
ground investigation at each specified stretch (normally 50 metres), called “reach”, and the
Consultant be directed to exercise such due diligence.
2.4.3
The involvement of the Ministry/ Department in providing proper inputs including
user requirements during the preparation of the DPR and before accepting the draft DPR is
paramount in ensuring successful implementation. Proper field surveys and investigations of
ground conditions are critical in preparation of a reliable DPR. Providing scientifically valid
data to bidders will depend on the quality of the investigations done by the DPR consultant.

19

As a corollary, the Ministry/ Department must insist on a qualified team of engineers with
experience for carrying out DPR studies. It is also essential that the Ministry/ Department
insists that the Consultant offers them technology options at the early stage of preparation
of the DPR, so that a cost-efficient choice may be made using principles of Life Cycle
Costing. In case the deviations between actual ground situation and the situation recorded
in such DPR results in significant cost and time over-runs, the engineer, while doing valuation
of variations [refer to Para 6.5.1 (iii)], must bring to Procuring Entity‘s notice the reach-wise
differences and the Ministry/ Department may consider stringent action against the
consultant who has prepared such DPRs, including debarment from future consultancy
contracts, after following due procedure. Such clauses may be included in the contracts for
preparation of DPR. Wherever consultants are appointed for preparation of DPR, field units
of the public authorities should also be associated with the process. The inputs from these
field units can be useful in proposing best solutions for design and execution of the work as
they are the custodian of legacy data, which may not be available with the consultants, as
they may not be operatingregularly in that geographical region.
2.4.4
Presentation may be made about the DPR before the public authority, for projects
above a threshold value, as decided by Project Executing Authorities. The presentation may
include salient features of the project including general layout, architectural drawings, broad
specifications, cash flow (over the life of the project), composition of the project team, quality
management plan for the project, important milestones in the project execution, obligations
of the authority and the contractor/ concessionaire (hereinafter referred to as "contractor'')
and possible risks and mitigation measures. In the case of very large projects such
presentation may be made to the head of the public authority. The record of discussions
during the presentation shall become part of tender file/project record.

2.5

Administrative Approval and Expenditure Sanction (A/A and E/S)

Administrative approval and Expenditure Sanction (A/A and E/S) will be accorded to the
execution of work by the competent Financial authority in the Ministry/ Department after due
examination of Detailed Project Report and Preliminary estimates. Post Sanction changes in
scope and specification lead to delay, loss of quality and contractual penalties therefore such
A/A and E/S shall be accorded after carefully assessing their requirements. The estimates
framed by a PWO or other engineering organisation may be modified for such sanction only
with their concurrence.
The sanction order should contain scope of work, estimated cost, and time schedule for
completion of work and funding sources along with their share.
Where a project as a whole has been sanctioned after scrutiny and acceptance by the Finance
Ministry, further concurrence of the Finance Ministry shall not be required for sanctioning
expenditure on the various constituent schemes included in the project. [Rule 18(1), DFPR,
1978]
2.6
Detailed Designs, Detailed Estimates and Technical Sanction
Except where the work is to be undertaken in the EPC(Turnkey) mode, on receipt of sanction
of the project, based on DPR or PE and assurance of funds, the procuring entity in
consultation with the Works Committee (as mentioned in para 3.1.4 (iv) below) shall prepare
and accord Technical Sanction to detailed and coordinated design of all the Architectural,
Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Horticulture and any other services included in the scope of the
sanction and of the Detailed Cost Estimates containing the detailed specifications and

20

quantities of various items prepared on the basis of the schedule of rates maintained by
CPWD or other Public Works Organizations - so as to ensure that proposals are structurally
sound and that the estimates are accurately calculated based on adequate data. In case the
work is to be executed through a Public Works Organization or Public Sector Undertaking,
preparation of detailed design/ estimates and technical sanction shall be done/ accorded by
that organization. Architectural and structural drawings: Architectural and structural drawings
(fit for construction) are among the core requirements for projects. Finalization of these
drawings at the earliest, preferably at the time of preparation of the cost estimate itself, can
help to determine quantities of various items of the work. Adverse consequences of not
preparing these drawings before invitation of tenders may manifest in the form of delay in
execution of the work and deviations in quantities of the items of work. Hence,approved
architectural and structural drawings should be available before invitation of tenders. Fit for
construction (sometimes called Good for construction) drawings means the architectural and
structural drawings approved by the project executing authority as well as by the authority
governing the extant rules/ laws, including byelaws, such as local authorities.

2.7

Appropriation of funds

Before taking up the execution of work it shall be ensured that proper funds are available to
meet out the expenditure on the work. It should also be emphasized that the DPR consultant
is able to provide realistic year wise requirement of funds. This information is necessary so
that concerned Ministries/ organizations may be intimated regarding the same. This will enable
them to include such funds projection in their budget.

2.8

Reference Documents used in preparation of Estimates

For preparation of estimates and during execution of work following reference documents are
used by PWOs. These may be separate for different regions, various types of works - Building,
Electrical and Mechanical. Annexure 10 lists further resources regarding Procurement of
Works.

i)

Plinth Area Rates which provide a quick but fairly accurate method of estimation of
cost of buildings (e.g. CPWD DPAR – Delhi Plinth Area Rates).
ii) Schedule of Rates for each kind of work commonly executed to facilitate the
preparation of estimates, as also to serve as a guide in settling rates in connection with
contract agreements, maintained up-to-date (e.g. CPWD DSR - Delhi Schedule of
Rates). Endeavour may be made to enlarge the base of the 'Schedule of Rates'
published by various organizations to bring a maximum number of items under its
ambit. For non-scheduled items, rates may be finalized by a committee constituted by
the organization concerned/ consultants as the casemay be.
iii) Analysis of Rates by taking market rates of labour, materials, cartage etc and their
quantities for each kind of work commonly executed (e.g. CPWD Analysis of Rates)
iv) Specifications describing inputs, processes, tests and mode of measurement for each
kind of work commonly executed (e.g. CPWD Specifications)

2.9

Procurement Planning

GFR 2017 [Rule 144 (x)] mandates that All Ministries/Departments shall prepare Annual
Procurement Plan within 30 (thirty) days of Budget approval, before the commencement of
the year and the same should also be placed on their website

21

Chapter 3: Agency for Procurement; Types of Contract, Bidding
Systems and Modes of Procurement
3.1

Agency for Procurement

Rule 133 of the GFR, 2017, permits Ministries/ Departments at its discretion to assign
execution of their original and repair works as follows:-

i) Directly by the Ministry/ Department
ii) Public Works Organisations (PWO)
iii) Public Sector Undertaking (PSU)/ Organisations setup to execute Works
3.1.1

Directly by the Ministry/ Department

A Ministry or Department at its discretion may directly execute repair works estimated to cost
up to Rupees thirty lakh after following due procedure ‘laid down for Execution of Works’ (Rule
139, 159 and 160 of GFR 2017).
3.1.2

Public Works Organisations

A Ministry or Department may, at its discretion, assign repair works estimated to cost above
Rupees thirty lakh and original works of any value to any Public Works Organisation (PWO)
such as Central Public Works Department (CPWD), State Public Works Department, others
Central Government organisations authorised to carry out civil or electrical works such as
Military Engineering Service (MES), Border Roads Organisation (BRO), etc. or Ministry/
Department’s construction wings of Ministries of Railways, Defence, Environment & Forests,
Information & Broadcasting and Departments of Posts, and Space etc.
3.1.3

Public Works PSU/ Organisations

As an alternative a Ministry or Department may assign repair works estimated to cost above
Rupees thirty lakh and original works of any value to:

i) any Public Sector Undertaking set up by the Central or State Government to carry out
civil or electrical works or

ii) to any other Central/ State Government organisation/ PSU which may be notified by
the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) for such purpose after evaluating their
financial strength and technical competence.
3.1.4

Procedure for Assigning Work to PWO or PSU/ Organisations

i) For the assignment of work under provisions of para 3.1.3 above to PSUs, the Ministry/
Department shall ensure competition among all such eligible PSUs/ organisations.
This competition shall be essentially on the lump sum service charges to be claimed
for execution of work. The award of work to a PSU should be taken as Project
Management Consultancy (PMC) and the concerned PSU shall be treated as
consultancy firm. Relevant methods (QCBS, LCS etc) for procurement of consultancy
will be applicable. For better understanding of selection methodology of consultant(s),
Rule 192 to Rule 194 of GFR 2017 and Manual for Procurement of Consultancy and
Other Services, 2017 may be referred.

22

ii) In exceptional cases, for assignment of work on nomination basis under provisions of
para 3.1.3 above to PSU, the conditions contained in para 3.5.7 below would apply.
The work under these circumstances shall also be assigned only on the basis of lump
sum basis.

iii) 18For original works and repair works entrusted under the provisions of Para 3.1.2 and
3.1.3 above, the administrative approval and expenditure sanction shall be accorded
and funds allotted by the concerned authority in accordance with the Para 1.12 (ii)
above. The Public Works Organisation or the Public Sector Undertaking or any
organisation allotted work shall then execute the work entrusted to it in accordance
with the rules and procedures prescribed in that organisation.

iv) A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) may be drawn with the Public Works
Organisation or the Public Sector Undertaking for proper execution of work. The MoU
should spell out the obligations on the part of Public Works Organization or PSU
regarding execution of works as per proper specifications and for maintaining proper
quality and speed of execution of works. Different stages at which funds shall be
released to the Public Works Organization should also be clearly spelt out. Such MoU
would normally be for a specific standalone work, but could also be for a Project
consisting of a collection of related works. In case of MoU with Public work
Organisations (PWOs) it could also be as a long-term framework MoU. A Sample MOU
delineating complete procedure of assignment of work to PWO/ PSUs and its
monitoring is shown in Annexure 8. Procuring entity may change the MOU format
suiting to their requirement, and If felt necessary may also get the MOU document
vetted from the Ministry of Law/ or its own legal cell.

v) For execution of any work, under the provisions of Para 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 above, the
Ministry/ Department shall constitute a “Works Committee”, whether on ad hoc or
standing basis; comprising of representatives of administrative wing and Finance wing
and an officer possessing technical skills and experience of framing estimates and
execution of works. If need be, members may be co-opted from User Department;
CPWD/ Public Works Organization/ PSUs or any technically sound Government
agency such as a relevant NIT/ IIT or a relevant National Research Institute etc. The
Works Committee shall ensure observance of due process in the planning and
execution of works, check the reasonability of the estimates and other technical details
and monitor the execution of the works.

3.2

Types of Contract

There are different basis for linking payments to the performance of Contract (called types of
contracts) – each having different risks and mitigation measures. Bids are called and
evaluated based on the type of contract. The choice of the type of contract should be based
on Value-for-Money (VfM) with due regard to the nature of Work. Adoption of an inappropriate
type of contract could lead to a situation of lack of competition, contractual disputes and nonperformance/ failure of the contract. Standard forms for all the types of contract mentioned
below are available with Public Works Organizations like CPWD and the same may be used

18

Rule 140, GFR, 2017

23

for calling the tenders. Each type of contract is described briefly in subsequent paras, and
criteria are suggested for their adoption. Mostly used types of contracts are:
3.2.1

Lump sum (Fixed Price) Contract

i)

This form is used for work in which contractors are required to quote a lump sum fixed
price figure for completing the works in accordance with the given designs,
specifications and functional requirements. Bidder’s price is deemed to include all
elements of cost - no arithmetical correction or price adjustments are allowed during
evaluation and execution. Lump sum contracts are easy to administer because it is a
fixed price for a fixed scope and payments are linked to clearly specified outputs/
milestones.

ii)

There may be tendency for the Contractor to cut corners on quality and scope of work
by saving on resources employed. Disputes may arise due to different possible
interpretations of quality and scope of work. The contract should include provision for
evaluation of quality and scope of work and certificate for its acceptability may be
recorded.

iii) As time is not linked to the payment, there may be tendency for the Contractor to save
on deployment of resources which may result in time-over-run. While the payments are
not linked to time, the assignment should be monitored per month to ensure that the
progress of work per month is in line with planned and estimated time-line.
iv) Lump sum service contracts should be used mainly for assignments in which the
quality, scope and the timing of the Work are clearly defined. Lump sum contracts may
be used where the Works can be defined in their full physical and qualitative
characteristics and risk for change in quantity or specification, and unforeseen
difficulties and site conditions (for example, hidden foundation problems) are minimal.
Thus is suitable for stereotype/ repetitive residential buildings or other structures for
which standard drawings are normally available. It is also suitable for minor bridge
works, chimneys, bins/ silos, overhead tanks, etc. whether on Department's design or
that of the contractor. In the latter case, the Department shall spell out the requirements
in detail to enable the contractor to prepare his designs and drawings accordingly, and
submit them to the Procuring Entity for check and approval before construction
v)

A Schedule of Rates (SOR) may still be specified in order to regulate the amounts to
be added to or deducted from the fixed sum on account of additions and alterations to
drawings, designs and specifications not covered by the contract.

vi) The contractor shall be paid from time to time as per the schedule specified in the
contract or the full amount on completion of the work. In The concept of priced “activity
schedules” may be used, to enable payments to be made on the basis of percentage
completion of each activity. The billing schedule shall commensurate with the actual
work done, and the risk of front-loading strictly guarded against.
vii) Detailed measurements of work done in a lump sum contract are not required to be
recorded, except in respect of additions and omissions. No reference is made in the
contract to the departmental estimate of the work, prevailing SOR or the quantities of
work to be done. Payment of additions and omissions is regulated by prevailing SOR
as agreed upon while approving the tender or the rates.
3.2.2

Item rate (Unit Rate) Contract

24

i)

For item rate tenders, contractors are required to quote rate for each individual items
of work on the basis of Bill of quantities (BOQ) provided by the Procuring Entity in the
Bid Documents. Reasonable variations in quantities can be allowed during the
execution in terms of the contract. This is the most commonly used contract type for
civil works.

ii)

The payment is made at the rate set out in the contract for the measured quantity within
prescribed range [usually +/- 15 (fifteen) percent per item] of the estimated quantity of
the initial BOQ.

iii) This type of contract is suitable for all types of major works such as buildings, bridges,
culverts, roads, sewer lines, irrigation works, and carries the least risk of uncertainty
for the parties.
iv) Specifications, design, drawings and contract conditions (including availability of land,
forest clearance, social and environmental impact assessment, where applicable) have
to be critically appraised before the initiation of procurement process, in order to
minimise the incidence of internal inconsistencies, variations, and situation of claims/
disputes or contract failure.
3.2.3
i)
ii)

Percentage Rate Contract
For percentage rate contract, the contractors are required to quote rate as overall
percentage above or below the total estimated cost.
This type of contract works best when the work does not involve major design process
and directions, and simple drawings are sufficient for execution. It saves on the time
and effort of detailed design before the procurement process. This type of tender can
be used in respect of for small and routine types of original works for which estimates
can be made based on available schedule of rates and all repair works e.g. levelling
and development works including such works as storm water drainage, water supply
and sewer lines.

iii) Bills for percentage rate contracts shall be prepared at the estimated rates for individual
items only and the percentage excess or less shall be added or subtracted from the
gross amount of the bill. The payment is made for the measured quantity. Contract
provisions are made to determine the price of the items not included in SOR. In the
absence of a standard schedule of rates, a project-specific schedule of items and their
rates is drawn.
3.2.4

Piece Work Contract

Piece Work Contract is to be used mainly in following cases:

i) The cases, in which it is necessary to start the work in anticipation of formal acceptance
of contract, an agreement on piece work contract may be drawn and the contract may be
cancelled as soon as regular contract is signed.

ii) For running contracts i.e. those for pipes, laying of sewerage etc. quotations are called
periodically and a running rate contract is drawn up as a result of those quotations usually
for one year. The piece work contract provides for payment of stipulated rates only when
it refers to such quantity of time and also stipulates that the procuring entity may put an
end to the agreement at his option at any time.
3.2.5

Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contracts

25

i)

The Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) (also called ‘Design & Build’
Contracts) approach relies on assigning the responsibility for investigations, design
and construction to the contractor for a lump sum price determined through competitive
bidding. The objective is to ensure implementation of the project to specified standards
with a fair degree of certainty relating to costs and time while transferring the
construction risks to the contractor.

ii)

On the recommendations of National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog)
the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)19 has recommended that Item
Rate contracts may be substituted by EPC contracts wherever appropriate.

iii)

Unlike the normal practice of construction specifications, the technical parameters in
the EPC Agreement are based mainly on output specifications / performance
standards. Procuring Entity specifies only the core requirements of design and
construction of the project that have a bearing on the quality durability, reliability,
maintainability and safety of assets and enough room is left for the contractor to add
value. The Contractor has full freedom to design and plan the construction schedule
using best practices to achieve quality, durability, reliability, maintainability, and safety
as specified along with efficiency and economy. Projects risks such as soil conditions
and weather or commercial and technical risks relating to design and construction are
assigned to the Contractor. The Procuring Entity bears the risk for any delays in
handing over the land, approvals from local authorities, environment clearances,
shifting of utilities and approvals in respect of engineering plans.

iv)

Selection of the contractor is based on open competitive bidding. All project parameters
such as the contract period, price adjustments and technical parameters are to be
clearly stated upfront, and short-listed bidders are required to specify only the lump
sum price for the project. The bidder who seeks the lowest payment is awarded the
contract. The contract price is subject to adjustment on account of price variation during
the contract period as per a specified formula. It also lays down a ceiling of 10 (Ten)
per cent of contract price to cater for any changes in the scope of project, the cost of
which the Procuring Entity will bear.

v)

The selected Contractor carries out survey and investigations and also develops
designs and drawings in conformity with the specifications and standards laid down in
the Agreement. Procuring Entity's engineer (also called owner’s engineer) reviews the
design and drawings to ensure that these conform to the scope of the project, design
standards and specifications. Any comments by the Procuring Entity on the design
proposals submitted by the contractor are to be communicated in totality once in a
time-bound manner as indicated in the schedule. The contractor is free to proceed with
construction after the expiry of specified period in case no remarks/ clearances are
given by the Procuring Entity.

vi)

The Contractor is liable to pay Liquidated Damages for each day of delay beyond the
specified date of completion, subject to the total amount of Damages not exceeding 10
(ten) per cent of the Contract Price. However, the Contractor is entitled to time
extension arising out of delays on account of change of scope and force majeure or
delays caused by or attributable to the Procuring Entity. If so provided in the Bid

19

Niti Aayog OM No. N-14070/14/2016-PPPAU dated September 05, 2016

26

Document, Procuring Entity is also liable to pay bonus (normally should not exceed ten
percent) to the Contractor for completion of the project before the scheduled
completion date, if so provided in the contract documents.

vii)

Monitoring and supervision of construction are undertaken through Procuring Entity’s
engineer, (a qualified firm that will be selected through a transparent process) acting
as a single window for coordination with the contractor.

viii)

Each item of work is further sub-divided into stages and payment based on output
specifications and performance standard is to be made for each completed stage of
work. Defects liability period of two years may be specified in the Agreement in order
to provide additional comfort to the Procuring Entity.

ix)

Federation Internationale Des Ingénieurs-Conseils (FIDIC - an International Federation
of Consulting Engineers, known by its French acronym) has also published such
contractual frameworks. Model EPC contract documents have been developed for
Highways and Railways and published by the erstwhile Planning Commission. National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has already adopted these documents and all
construction contracts are currently being structured on this model. Ministry of
Railways has also started using such documents. Model bidding documents and Model
EPC contracts suitably revisited or modified wherever required to suit the requirements
of particular sectors, may be adopted.

x)

The selected Procuring Entity’s Engineer (Consultant) has to have good experience in
design, project supervision and works management. The Procuring Entity organisation
must have an experienced team with (works committee) to super check the quality of
supervision exercised by the owner’s engineer, including quality of design review, site
supervision, quality audits, etc. Periodic audits of the Procuring Entity’s Engineer
functioning are desirable in ensuring that the Procuring Entity’s Engineer carries out
his tasks professionally.

xi)

In complex projects, a third party consultant be deployed for specific tasks like design
audit, quality audits, safety audits, etc., to cross-check the Procuring Entity’s
Engineer’s diligence in the process.
xii) In EPC contracts, since primary responsibility to execute the work lies with the EPC
contractor, success of the project also depends upon the quality of the tender document
wherein enough clarity on the broad framework for execution of the work and the
obligations of the contractor needs to be built in.
xiii)Milestones for payment to the contractor should be fixed in a manner that facilitates smooth
cash flow for the contractor as well as for progress of the work. Milestones fixed should
avoid excessive front loading or back loading, i.e., amount of payment should be
commensurate with stage-wise quantum of work/ cost incurred. Milestones for payment to
the contractor should also be linked with the deliverables.
xiv) In case of EPC contracts, only general arrangement drawings and architectural control
parameters should be part of the PEC tender document. In case of EPC contracts,
timelines for submission of drawings by the contractors and approval thereof by the
competent authority should be clearly prescribed in the tender document, wherein,
damages for non-adherence of such timelines ins this regard may also be incorporated.
xv) EPC contracts shall specify broad technical specification and key output parameters.
Over-specification of design may lead to increase in cost. Technical specifications shall be

27

framed in such a manner to allow sufficient freedom to the contractor to optimize design.
Provisions on the following should be included in commercial conditions :
a)
Limitation of liability for procuring entity as well as contractor.
b)
Deviation limits and procedure for change of scope.
c)
Contract closing timelines and procedure to ensure timely closing of contract.
d)
Performance parameters and liquidated damages for shortfall in performance
e)
Risk matrix and responsibilities of the contractor and the procuring entity.
xvi) In addition, a latent defect period beyond the defect liability period may be included to
protect the procuring entity and public authority interest in case of any design/ engineering
defect after the defect liability period is over, wherever appropriate.
xvii) To mitigate the risk in volved in the methodology proposed by the contractor, the
project executive authority shall either have an in-house engineering, quality assurance
and project management expert or alternatively hire an experienced engineer to
intensively examine the proposal submitted by the contractor. Project executing
authorities are to ensure that optimal technological solutions are provided by the
contractor.
xviii) To ensure equality, regular inspection and quality checks must be carried out. The
Project, executing authority shall carry out stage inspections in manufacturing of critical
equipment/critical activities of the project.
Note: In para 3.2.5 instructions containing “shall” are mandatory; any deviation from these
instructions shall require relaxation from Ministry of Finance (for Ministries/ Departments etc.)
or from the Board of Directors (for Central Public Sector Enterprises).
3.2.6

Public Private Partnership (PPP)

PPP means an arrangement between a government/ statutory entity/ government owned
entity on one side [Sponsoring (PPP) authority – or simply the Authority] and a private sector
entity (a legal entity in which 51% or more of equity is with the private partner/s concessionaire) on the other, for the creation and/ or management of public assets and/ or
public services, through investments being made and/ or management being undertaken by
the concessionaire, for a specified period of time (concession period) on commercial terms,
where there is well defined allocation of risk between the concessionaire and the Authority;
and the concessionaire (who is chosen on the basis of a transparent and open competitive
bidding), receives performance linked payments that conform (or are benchmarked) to
specified and pre-determined performance standards, measurable by the Authority or its
representative. For further information, PPP instructions issue by Department of Economic
Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance from time to time, may be referred.

3.3

Bidding Systems

Bidding systems are designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the countervailing
needs for Right Quality, Right Source and the Right Price under different complexities/
criticality of Technical requirements and value of procurements. In certain critical and complex
requirements, the technical and financial capability of Source of supply becomes an important
determinant for value for money. Depending on the complexity and criticality Technical of
requirement, Criticality of capability of Source and value of procurement, following types of
bidding systems may be used.
3.3.1

Single Stage Bidding System

28

In single stage bidding, all bids are invited together in a single envelope or in multiple
envelopes system. This bidding system is suitable where technical requirements are simple
or moderate; capability of source of supply is not too crucial and the value of procurement is
not too high;
3.3.2

Single Stage Single Bid/ Envelope System (1S1E)

Where it is feasible to work out the schedule of quantities and to formulate detailed
specifications for Works and capability of contractor isn’t critical and value of procurement is
low or moderate, the single envelope system may be adopted, where eligibility, technical/
commercial and financial details are submitted together in the same envelope. This is the
simplest and the quickest bidding system. The lowest responsive priced bid that meets the
eligibility criteria, technical and commercial requirements laid down in the bid documents is
declared as successful and awarded the contract.
3.3.3

Single Stage Two Envelope Systems (1S2E)

In technically complex requirements but where capability of source of supply is still not crucial
and value of procurement is not low, a two envelope system may be followed:

i) If required, Technical specification and techno-commercial conditions may be
modified, after the pre-bid conference in the two envelopes. The pre-bid conference is
to be organised before the bid submission date. It may be necessary to issue the prebid conference minutes to all participants/ upload to the web-portals and some revised
RfQ/ RfP documents where necessary.
ii) The tenderers should be asked to bifurcate their quotations in two envelopes. The first
envelope, called the techno-commercial bid, contains the eligibility, technical quality
and performance aspects, commercial terms and conditions and documents sought in
the tender, except the price and relevant financial details. In the second envelope,
called the financial bid, the price quotations along with other financial details are
submitted. Both the envelope are to be submitted together in a sealed outer envelope,
as it would not be desirable to invite financial bids after opening of techno-commercial
bids;
iii) The techno-commercial bids are to be opened in the first instance on the bid opening
date and time, and scrutinised and evaluated by the tender committee (TC) with
reference to parameters prescribed in the tender documents and responsive, eligible
and technically compliant bidders are decided;
iv) Thereafter, in the second instance, the financial bids of only the techno-commercially
compliant offers (as decided in the first instance above) are to be opened on a preannounced date and time for further scrutiny, evaluation, ranking and placement of
contract. The financial bids of technically non-compliant bidders should be returned
unopened to the respective bidders by registered acknowledgement due/ reliable
courier or any other mode with proof of delivery. In e-Procurement, financial bids of
technically non-compliant offers would not get opened;
3.3.4

Single Stage Multiple Envelope System (with post-qualification, 1S3E)

As discussed below, where the procurement is moderately complex and the time, effort and
money required from the bidder to participate in a tender is not very high, instead of a separate
stage of Pre-Qualification bidding (as described below), a clear-cut, fail-pass qualification
criteria can be asked to be submitted as the first (additional) envelope in a three envelope

29

single stage bidding, so that a bidder's risk of having his bid rejected on grounds of
qualifications is remote if due diligence is exercised him. Strictly speaking, this is not a prequalification but a Post-qualification of bidders (as in case of Single Envelope and Two
Envelope Bidding). In the first instance on the bid opening date only the post-qualification
envelope (also containing the EMD and other eligibility documents) is opened and evaluated
to qualify the responsive bidders who pass the post-qualification. Rest of procedure is same
as two envelope system for only qualified bidders. Rest two envelopes of unqualified bidders
are returned unopened to the respective bidders by registered acknowledgement due/ reliable
courier or any other mode with proof of delivery;
3.3.5

Two Stage Bidding with Expression of Interest (EoI)

i) There are instances where the Works to be procured are of complex nature and the
procuring organization may not possess the full knowledge of either the various
technical solutions available or the likely Contractors for such Works. To meet the
desired objectives of a transparent procurement that ensures value for money
simultaneously ensuring up gradation of technology & capacity building- it would be
prudent to invite a two-stage Expression of Interest (EoI) Bids and proceed to explore
the market and to finalise specifications based on technical discussions/ presentations
with the experienced Contractors in a transparent manner. Expression of Interest (EoI)
bids may be invited in following situations:
i)

It is not feasible for the procuring entity to formulate detailed specifications or
identify specific characteristics for the subject matter of procurement, without
receiving inputs regarding its technical aspects from bidders;

ii) The character of the subject matter of procurement is subject to rapid technological
advances or market fluctuations or both;
iii) The procuring entity seeks to enter into a contract for the purpose of research,
experiment, study or development; or
iv) The bidder is expected to carry out a detailed survey or investigation and undertake
a comprehensive assessment of risks, costs and obligations associated with the
particular procurement.

ii) The procedure for two stage bidding shall include the following, namely:
i)

In the first stage of the bidding process, the procuring entity shall invite EoI bids
containing the broad objectives, technical and financial eligibility criteria, terms and
conditions of the proposed procurement etc without a bid price. On receipt of the
Expressions of Interest, technical discussions/ presentations may be held with the
short-listed Contractors, which are prima facie considered technically and
financially capable of executing the proposed work, giving equal opportunity to all
such bidders to participate in the discussions. During these technical discussions
stage the procurement agency may also add those other stake holders in the
discussions who could add value to the decision making on the various technical
aspects and evaluation criteria. Based on the discussions/ presentations so held,
one or more acceptable technical solutions could be decided upon laying down
detailed technical specifications for each acceptable technical solution, quality
bench marks, warranty requirements, delivery milestones etc., in a manner that is
consistent with the objectives of the transparent procurement. At the same time

30

care should be taken to make the specifications generic in nature so as to provide
equitable opportunities to the prospective bidders. Proper record of discussions/
presentations and the process of decision making should be kept;
ii) In revising the relevant terms and conditions of the procurement, if found necessary
as a result of discussions with the shortlisted bidders, the procuring entity shall not
modify the fundamental nature of the procurement itself;
iii) In the second stage of the bidding process, the procuring entity shall invite bids
from all those bidders whose bids at the first stage were not rejected, to present
final bid with bid prices in response to a revised set of terms and conditions of the
procurement; and
iv) Any bidder, invited to bid, but not in a position to execute the work due to
modification in the specifications or terms and conditions, may withdraw from the
bidding proceedings without forfeiting any bid security that he may have been
required to provide or being penalised in any way, by declaring his intention to
withdraw from the procurement proceedings with adequate justification.
v) If the procuring entity is of the view that after EOI stage, there is likelihood of further
participation by many more bidders and to avoid getting trapped into a legacy
technology, the second stage bidding may not be restricted only to the shortlisted
bidders of EOI stage and it may be so declared in the EOI document ab-initio.
Thereafter in the second stage, normal OTE/ GTE bidding may be done. Such
variant of EOI is called ‘Non-committal’ EOI.

iii) Invitation of EoI Tenders: In EoI tenders, an advertisement inviting expression of
interest should be published. The invitation to the EoI document should contain the
following information:
i)

A copy of the advertisement;

ii) Objectives and scope of the requirement: This may include a brief description of
objectives and broad scope of the requirement;
iii) Instructions to the bidders: This may include instructions regarding the nature of
work, last date of submission, place of submission and any other related
instructions;
iv) Formats for submission: This section should specify the format in which the bidders
are expected to submit their EoI;
v) The EoI document should be made available to the interested bidder as a hard
copy as well as on its website in a downloadable form; and
Pre-Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) Conference: In complex and innovative procurement cases
or where the procuring entity may not have the required knowledge to formulate tender
provisions, a pre-NIT conference mayhelp the procuring entity in obtaining inputs from the
industry. Such conferences should be widely publicised so that different potential suppliers
can attend.

iv) Eligibility criteria: The invitation to EoI should clearly lay down the eligibility criteria,
which should be applied for short listing. Supporting documents required need to be
clearly mentioned. An example of EoI eligibility criteria is shown in Table 1. However,

31

appropriate eligibility criteria have to be designed, keeping in mind the specific
objectives of the EoI. Criteria used should be measurable and based on documents
that are verifiable. Definitions and explanatory notes shall be provided for each criteria
that are simple and unambiguous. It may also be advisable to cross-check and verify
these documents, when in doubt.

*Weightages (out of 100) should be pre-decided and declared in EoI documents by the CA based on assessment
of the required profiles of the potential bidders. The marking/ grading scheme for allotting marks (out of 100) for
various parameters should also be laid down.

v) Evaluation of EoI: The bidders should be evaluated for short listing, inter-alia, based
on their past experience of performance in a similar context, financial strength and
technical capabilities, among others. Each bidder should be assigned scores based on
the sum of marks obtained for each parameter multiplied by the weightages assigned
to that parameter. All bidders who secure the minimum required marks [normally 60
(sixty) per cent] should be shortlisted. The minimum qualifying marks should be
specified in the EoI document. Alternatively, instead of weighted evaluation, the EoI
document may specify a ‘fail-pass criteria’ with the minimum qualifying requirement for
each of the criteria, such as minimum years of experience, minimum number of Works
executed and minimum financial turnover. Under such circumstances, all bidders who
meet the minimum requirement, as specified, should be shortlisted. The short list
should normally comprise at least four firms.
3.3.6

Pre-qualification Bidding (PQB)

i)

In high value contracts or complex technical requirements where capability of source
of supply is crucial (for example in construction of complex bridges), for the successful
performance of the contract, besides considering techno-commercial suitability, it is
necessary to ensure that competition is only among bidders with requisite capabilities
matching the challenges of the task. In case bidders with inadequate capability are
allowed to compete, the better qualified bidders would be eliminated, since their bid
price is likely to be higher commensurate with their higher capability and infrastructure.
In such situations a separate stage of PQB bidding system may be considered (or
single stage multiple envelope bidding – please refer para 3.3.4 above). In PQB stage,
competent qualified tenderers are shortlisted prior to the issue of the bid document

32

exclusively to shortlisted bidders in the second stage by using a Pre-qualification
Criterion (PQC).

ii)

Pre-qualification Bids (PQBs) should meet the norms of transparency, fairness and
maintenance of competition. Since PQB system may strain the transparency principle
and there is heightened risk of cartelization among shortlisted bidders, PQB should be
done only as an exception under specified circumstances. It should not be a routine/
normal mode of procurement of works and an eligibility criteria clause (postqualification) as part of single/ two envelope/ cover tendering should suffice in normal/
routine situations. PQB bidding as a separate stage is contra-indicated in the following
circumstances:
i)

Where procurement can be done through limited tender enquiries;

ii) Where the requirement is technically and commercially simple enough that prequalification of the bidder is not crucial for the performance of the contract, for
example, routine residential buildings; and
iii) Where the procurement is of medium value (say less than Rs 100 crore) or
moderately complex in nature and the time, effort and money required from the
bidder to participate in a tender is not very high, a clear-cut, (preferably fail-pass)
post-qualification criteria can be specified in a three envelope single stage bidding
(instead of separate PQB bidding), so that a bidder’s risk of having his bid rejected
on grounds of qualifications is remote if due diligence is exercised him.

iii)

Pre-qualification Criteria: PQC should be unrestrictive enough so as not to leave out
even one capable bidder/ contractor. Otherwise, it can lead to higher prices of
procurement/ works/ services. However, on the other hand, these criteria should be
restrictive enough so as not to allow even one incapable bidder/ contractor and thus
vitiate fair competition for capable bidders/ contractors to the detriment of the Procuring
Entity’s objectives. A misjudgement in either direction may be detrimental. Certain
guidelines20 regarding the framing of PQC have been laid down. Due consideration
should be given while framing PQC, to its effect on adequacy of competition. PQC
should therefore be carefully decided for each procurement with the approval of
competent authority (CA). It should be clarified in the PQB documents that bidders
have to submit authenticated documents in support of eligibility criteria. Specific criteria
of 'pass' for each attribute will be as specified in the standard pre-qualification
document. A bidder may be awarded more than one contract in a Tender if he: (a)
meets the PQC of each of them; (b) demonstrates having the resources in respect of
financial, personnel and equipment capabilities to meet the aggregate of the specified
capabilities for each contract; and (c) has bidding capacity at the time of bidding, as
calculated by the above formula, more than the total estimated cost of these works.
The attributes PQC should cover inter-alia:
a) General Construction Experience: Annual Turnover
The applicant should have achieved minimum annual value of general construction
work (as certified by Chartered Accountant, and at least 50(fifty) percent of which is
from Engineering (Civil/ Electrical/ Mechanical as relevant to the work being procured)
construction works) carried out in any of the year over a stated period (normally five to

20

http:/ / cvc.nic.in/ six.pdf

33

seven years, ending 31st March of previous year), calculated by applying an
appropriate multiplier to the projected annual construction expenditure on the subject
contract. The multiplier of 2 may be used, but for very large contracts should not be
less than 1.5.
b) Particular Construction Experience and Key Production Rates
The applicant should have:
1.

successfully completed or substantially completed similar works during
last seven years ending last day of month previous to the one in which
applications are invited should be either of the following: -

1.1

Three similar completed works costing not less than the amount equal
to 40(forty) percent of the estimated cost; or

1.2

Two similar completed works costing not less than the amount equal to
50 (fifty) percent of the estimated cost; or

1.3

One similar completed work costing not less than the amount equal to
80 (eighty) percent of the estimated cost; and

2.

Definition of “similar work” should be clearly defined.

2.1

The pre-qualification criteria specified in the tender document should
neither be made very stringent nor very lax to restrict/ facilitate the entry
of bidders. It is clarified that the guidelines issued are illustrative and
the organizations may suitably modify these guidelines for specialized
jobs/works, if considered necessary. However, it should be ensured that
the PQ criteria are exhaustive, yet specific and there is fair competition.
It should also be ensured that the PQ criteria are clearly stipulated in
unambiguous terms in the bid documents.)

3.

The applicant should also have achieved the minimum annual
production value of the key construction activities (e.g. dredging, piling,
or earthworks etc) stipulated.

The similarity of work shall be pre-defined based on the physical size, complexity,
methods/ technology and/ or other characteristics described, and scope of works.
Substantial completion shall be based on 80 (eighty) per cent (value wise) or more
works completed under the contract (Note: Substantial completion should not be
defined in terms of percentage completion, rather it should be based on functional
consideration. For contracts under which the applicant participated as a joint venture
member or sub-contractor, only the applicant’s share, by value, shall be considered to
meet this requirement. For arriving at cost of similar work, the value of work executed
shall be brought to current costing level by enhancing the actual value of work at simple
rate of seven percent per annum, calculated from the date of completion to the date of
Bid opening.
Certificate for ‘substantial completion’ of project/work/asset should contain two parts.
Part -I shall contain ‘financial value of work done’ and part-II shall contain ‘certificate of
functional completion of project/work/asset’.
c) Financial Capabilities

34

The applicant should have: (i) access to, or possess available liquid assets and other
financial means (independent of any contractual advance payments) sufficient to meet
the construction cash flow requirements for the subject contract, of the certain
minimum amount specified; (ii) adequate sources of finance to meet the cash flow
requirements of works currently in progress and for future contract commitments; and
(iii) financial soundness as established by audited balance sheets and/ or financial
statements. Average Annual Financial Turnover of the bidders during the last three
years ending 31st March of the previous financial year should be at least 30% of the
estimated cost.
d)

Personnel Capabilities

The applicant's key personnel, as listed in the pre-qualification document, should meet
the requirements of qualification and experience specified. The pre-qualification
criteria should, refer to a limited number of such key personnel, for instance, the project
or contract manager and those superintendents working under the project manager
who will be responsible for major components (for example, superintendents
specialised in dredging, piling, or earthworks, as required for each particular project).
Criteria of acceptability should be based on:
1. A minimum qualification related to the work, if considered desirable;
2. A minimum number of years of experience in a similar position; and
3. A minimum number of years of experience and/ or number of comparable projects
carried out in a specified number of preceding years.
e)

Equipment Capabilities

The applicant should own, or have assured access (through hire, lease, purchase
agreement, other commercial means) to the specified key items of equipment, in full
working order, and satisfy that, based on known commitments; it will be available for
timely use on the proposed contract. The pass–fail criteria adopted should be limited
only to those bulky or specialised items that are critical for the type of project to be
implemented (say heavy lift cranes and piling barges, dredgers, asphalt mixing plants),
and so on. Contractors may not own the specialised items of equipment, and may rely
on specialist sub-contractors or equipment–hire firms.
(e)

Available Bid Capacity

The bidder should possess the bidding capacity as calculated by the specified formula.
The formula generally used is:
Available bid capacity = A x M x N -B, where
A = Maximum value of engineering (Civil/ Electrical/ Mechanical as relevant to work
being procured) works executed in any one year during the last five years (updated at
the current price level), taking into account the completed as well as works in progress.
M = Multiplier Factor (usually 1.5)
N = Number of years prescribed for completion of the work in question.
B = Value (updated at the current price level) of the existing commitments and ongoing
works to be completed in the next 'N' years.
(f)

Pre-qualification of JV

35

JV members are “jointly and severally responsible and liable” in a contract. For prequalification, the JV should fulfil the criteria specified in the pre-qualification document.
The attributes to be evaluated will be the same as for individual contractors; however,
certain parameters up to the specified limits have to be essentially met by them
collectively, some by the lead partner, and some by the other partner, as briefly
described below:
1. Qualifying factors to be met collectively: (i) annual turnover from construction; (ii)
particular construction experience and key production rates; (iii) construction cash
flow for the subject contract; (iv) personnel capabilities; and (v) equipment
capabilities;
2. Qualifying factors for lead partner: (i) Annual Turnover from Construction; (ii)
particular construction experience; (iii) financial capability to meet cash flow
requirement of subject contract –not less than of 50 (fifty) per cent of the respective
limits prescribed in case of individual contractors may be accepted; (iv) adequate
sources to meet financial commitments on other contracts; (v) financial soundness;
3. Qualifying factors for other partner: Same as for lead partner except that for the
factors specified in (2) (iii) above, a lower limit of 25 (twenty-five) per cent may be
accepted instead of 50 (fifty) per cent.
(g)

Disqualification

Even if an applicant meets the eligibility criteria (Please refer Para 4.5 below) and PQC,
he shall be subject to disqualification if he or any of the constituent partners is found
to have:
1. made misleading or false representations in the forms, statements, affidavits and
attachments submitted in proof of the qualification requirements; and/ or;
2. Records of poor performance during the last five years, as on the date of
application, such as abandoning the work, rescission of the contract for reasons
which are attributable to non-performance of the contractor, inordinate delays in
completion, consistent history of litigation resulting in awards against the contractor
or any of the constituents, or financial failure due to bankruptcy, and so on. The
rescission of a contract of venture JV on account of reasons other than nonperformance, such as the most experienced partner (major partner) of JV pulling
out;
3. On account of currency of debarment by any Government agency.
(iv)
Advertisement and Notification: The invitation for PQB shall be processed
(advertised, bid document preparation, publicity and evaluation, and so on) in the same
manner as a normal GTE or OTE (as the situation calls for) tender, ensuring the widest
possible coverage. The PQC and evaluation criterion should be notified clearly in the PQB
documents. A minimum period of 21 (twenty-one) days may be allowed for the submission of
PQBs. In the case of urgency, duly approved by CA, the time limit may be reduced to 30 (thirty)
days. The PQB documents should also indicate
a) Scope of work (in physical as well monetary terms);
b) Pre-qualification criteria for single contractors and joint ventures;

36

c) Disqualification clause for misleading statements, or the applicant found to be
ineligible on the basis of facts;
d) Various questionnaires and forms, required to be answered and filled by the
prospective applicant, in support of pre-qualification;
e) Form of affidavit by the applicant in certification of the statements made and
information given by him;
f)

Indicative requirements of qualifications and experience of key personnel for the
project;

g) Indicative requirements of annual production rates of key items of work;
h) Indicative requirements of major plant and equipment;
i)

Indicative quantities of major items of work;

j)

Description of the project area, its climate and language, site of work and means
of access; and

k) Key plan of project area along with the site plan.
v)

Empanelment of contractors: Public authorities may empanel/ register contractors
of those specific goods and services which are required by them regularly.
Performance of such empanelled contractors should be reviewed periodically.
The list of registered contractors shall be updated on a regular basis. The
category/ class of contractors may be upgraded/ downgraded or contractors may
be de-listed based on their performance. Empanelment of contractors shall be
done in a fair and equitable manner, preferably online after giving due publicity.
The practice of inviting bids for works tenders only from empanelled contractors
may be confined to tenders up to certain threshold value, as decided by the
project executing authorities.

(vi)

Evaluation

At least in high value and critical procurements, the credentials regarding experience and past
performance, submitted by the successful bidder, may be verified as per PQC criteria, as far
as reasonably feasible, from the parties for whom work has been claimed to be done. The
procuring entity shall evaluate the qualifications of bidders only in accordance with the PQC
specified and shall give due publicity to the particulars of the bidders that are qualified on the
relevant portals/ websites.
(vii)

Subsequent Procurement Tender

The pre-qualification shall be valid for such period as may be specified in the pre-qualification
document and for a single subsequent procurement within this period, except when it is
determined that engaging in fresh pre-qualification shall not result in enhanced competition.
During the period of such validity, the procuring entity shall invite bids for procurement
(Request for Proposals – RfP) from pre-qualified bidders and all other bids may be treated as
unsolicited offers which are normally rejected. In case bids are not invited within such a period,
fresh pre-qualification shall be done. It is desirable that the time gap between the prequalification approval and floating of the linked main procurement tender is less than six
months. EoI should clearly specify the duration for which the pre-qualification criteria(s) is

37

valid. After the expiry of such duration whenever a subsequent procurement shall be carried
out, fresh pre-qualification criteria shall be incorporated in such tender documents.
3.3.7

Pre-Qualification Bidding – Risks and Mitigations:

Risk
Pre-qualification criteria: PQB has the
potential of getting misused or being applied
without considering the restrictive nature of
competition. PQC should be relevant to the
quality requirements and neither is very
stringent nor very lax to restrict/ facilitate the
entry of bidders. These criteria should be
clear, unambiguous, exhaustive and yet
specific. Also, there should be fair
competition.

Mitigation
Lay down criteria when prequalification in
single stage or two stage bidding is
warranted. Also lay down model PQC criteria
for different types of procurements. There
must also be an understanding of the size,
capacity and competencies of contractors in
India and in the Global marketplace.

Dangers of Anti-competitive bidding:
Since in a two stage PQB, shortlisted
bidders are announced, there is heightened
possibility of these bidders forming a cartel
and quoting anti-competitive prices in the
second stage of bidding.

Two stage PQB should be done only in
appropriately
justified
situations.
Alternatively, Single Stage multiple envelope
system may be used for prequalification, in
which chances of anti-competitive behaviour
and time-taken is significantly lesser.

Two Stage PQB is a time-consuming
process.
Contentious and Disputes: Both the
successful and unsuccessful bidders tend to
view PQB process as a means for creating
rights/ privileges/ entitlement for them by
way of hair-splitting, contentious or viciously
legalistic interpretations of PQC criteria,
disregarding the very rationale of the PQB
and PQC.

3.4

In the PQC a caveat against such
tendencies may be included, asserting the
right of procuring agency to interpret the
PQC on common usage of terminologies
and phrases in public procurement instead
of legalistic and hair-splitting judgements
and that their decision in this regard would
be final.

Electronic Procurement (e-Procurement)

Rule 160 of GFR 2017 makes it mandatory for Ministries/ Departments to receive all bids
through e-procurement portals in respect of all procurements. Ministries/ Departments which
do not have a large volume of procurement or carry out procurements required only for dayto-day running of offices and al so have not initiated e-procurement through any other solution
provided so far, may use e-procurement solution developed by NIC i.e. Central Public
Procurement Portal (CPPP).F Other Ministries/ Departments may either use CPPP or engage
any other service provider following due process. There are other service providers in Public
Sector (e.g. MSTC) and Private sector which can be utilized for e-Procurement. In individual
case where national security and strategic considerations demands confidentiality, Ministries/
Departments may exempt such cases from e-procurement after seeking approval of
concerned Secretary and with concurrence of Financial Advisers. In case of tenders floated
by Indian Missions Abroad, Competent Authority to decide the tender may exempt such case

38

from e-procurement as the bidders may face problems in obtaining digital signatures which is
pre-requisite for bidding. Details about the process of e-procurement are available from the
service providers. Appendix 3 also gives such generic details of the e-Procurement process.
The e-procurement solutions meet all the requirements notified by Department of Information
Technology under the Guidelines for compliances to Quality requirements of e-procurement
systems published on the e-Governance Standards Portal (http://egovstandards.gov.in)

3.5

Modes of Tendering

Offers from prospective bidders in public procurement must be invited according to a
procedure that achieves a balance between the need for the widest competition, on one hand,
and complexity of the procedure, on the other hand. Different modes of procurement and
bidding systems are used to suit various procurement circumstances to achieve this balance.
There are laid down procedures for delegation of powers of procurement to various competent
authorities under different modes as shown in DFPR. Each procuring entity may also publish
its own Schedule of Procurement Powers (SOPP) delegating such powers within the entity.
The various modes of procurement that can be used in public procurement of works are:

i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)

Open Tender Enquiry (OTE); and
Global Tender Enquiry (GTE);
Limited Tender Enquiry - LTE (up to Rs. five lakh); [Rule 139 (iii) of GFR, 2017]
Single Tender Enquiry (STE) or selection by nomination;
Award of Work through Quotations.

3.5.1

21

Open Tender Enquiry (OTE)

i) In OTE, an attempt is made to attract the widest possible competition by publishing the
NIT simultaneously on the designated websites and in the press (newspapers and
trade journals). This is the default mode of procurement and gives the best value for
money but the procedure is relatively complex and prolonged. The systemic cost of
this procedure may be high enough to be unviable for smaller value procurements.
OTE procedures through e-procurement or through traditional tendering should be
adopted for procurement values above Rs five lakh.

ii) Terms and Conditions
a) Participation should not be restricted to only Bidders enlisted with the Procuring
Entity. Bidders already enlisted are also free to participate. However, a requirement
that successful un-enlisted Bidders may have to get enlisted with the Procuring
Entity, before contract is placed on them.
b)

21

GFR 2017 (Rule 159) makes it mandatory for all Ministries/ Departments of the
Central Government, their attached and Subordinate Offices and Autonomous
/Statutory Bodies to publish their tender enquiries, corrigenda thereon and details
of bid awards on the Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) and has
dispensed with print-advertisements in Newspaper etc. An organisation having its
own web site should also publish all its advertised tender enquiries on the web
site. The procuring entity should also post the complete bidding document in its
web site and on CPPP to enable prospective bidders to make use of the document
by downloading from the web site. The advertisements for invitation of tenders

Rule 161, GFR 2017

39

should give the complete web address from where the bidding documents can be
downloaded (for details see para 4.3). In order to promote wider participation and
ease of bidding, no cost of tender document may be charged for the tender
documents downloaded by the bidders; and

3.5.2

c)

The tender documents should be prepared on the basis of the relevant approved
SBD for the category of procurement. Further details on preparing tender
documents are provided in Chapter 4.

d)

The sale/ availability for downloading of tender documents against NIT should not
be restricted and should be available freely. Tender documents should be
available for download free of cost up to the date of opening of tenders. The
organization should also post the complete tender document in the web site and
permit prospective tenderers to make use of the document downloaded from the
web site. If the tender document is a priced one, there should be clear instructions
for the tenderers in the document (which has been downloaded) to pay the amount
by demand draft etc. along with the tender, prepared in the downloaded document.

e)

The procuring entity shall maintain proper records about the number of tender
documents sold, list of parties to whom sold, details of the amount received
through sale and, also, the number of unsold tender documents, which are to be
cancelled after the opening of the tenders.

OTE - Risks and Mitigations

Risk

Mitigation

Since the crux of this mode of
procurement is attracting bids from
all possible prospective bidders.
The risk is that this may not be
achieved, even after incurring
extra cost of open tendering. This
could be due to
•
•
•
•

It should be ensured that the NIT on the website is
easily searchable and visible, not hidden under layers
of clicks. The matter should not be left entirely to the
website or media publicity alone. Due diligence should
be done to locate likely bidders (including past
bidders) and their attention should be drawn though
SMS/ mail/ email. All enlisted vendors/ contractors (in
particular past successful vendors/ contractors)

It should be also ensured that there is no impediment
to issue/ access of bid documents.
The due date fixed for opening of the tender shall be
minimum 21 (twenty-one) days from the date of
advertisement which may vary, taking into account the
nature of material called for and delivery requirements.
The due date may be subsequently extended with the
approval of the CA, only if it is felt necessary to have
better competition.

OTE - Risks and Mitigations

Risk

Mitigation
The tender documents, shall be priced minimally (if at
all priced, refer Para 4.4
Issue/ Availability and
Cost of Tender Documents) keeping in view the value
of the tender as also the cost of preparation and
publicity of the tender documents.
EMD should be sufficient to ensure that bidders
honour their bids but at the same time should not be
large enough to reduce competition.

Lack of clarity in description/ Mitigations of such risks can be addressed at the time
specification of requirement or of need assessment and procurement planning, so as
undue stringency in qualifying to attract adequate competition.
criteria or other conditions
3.5.3

22

i)

GTE is similar to OTE but, through appropriate advertising and provision for payment
in Foreign Currencies through Letter of Credit, it is aimed at inviting the participation of
inter-alia foreign firms. The point of balance between VfM and cost/ complexity of
procedure is further aggravated as compared to OTE. Development of local industry
also needs to be kept in mind. Hence, it may be viable only in following situations:

ii)

Global Tender Enquiry (GTE)

a)

Where required Technology/ specifications/ quality are not available within the
country and alternatives available in the country are not suitable for the
purpose;

b)

Very high value contracts (procuring entities may adopt threshold limit e.g.
above Rs 100 crore) or where absence of a sufficient number of competent
domestic bidders likely to comply with the required technical specifications, and
in case of suspected cartel formation among indigenous bidders where
participation of International bidders would enhance value for money.

Terms and Conditions
i)

Publishing of tenders may be done as described in case of OTE above. In addition,
in GTE tenders copies of NIT should be circulated to Indian Embassies in relevant
countries and embassies of those countries in India; and; and

ii)

The tender documents, shall be priced minimally (if at all priced, refer Para 4.4
below) keeping in view the value of the tender as also the cost of preparation and
publicity of the tender documents;

iii) GTE tender documents must be in English and the price should be asked in Indian
Rupees or US Dollars or Euros or Pound Sterling or Yen or in currencies under

22

Rule 161, GFR 2017

41

the Reserve Bank of India’s notified basket of currencies or a mix of any of these
currencies;
iv) GTE tender documents must contain technical specifications which are in
accordance with national requirements or else based on an international trade
standard;
v)

The due date fixed for opening of the tender shall be usually about four to six
weeks from the date of advertisement which may vary taking into account the
nature of material called for as well as the time required to prepare the bids. The
due date may be subsequently extended with the approval of the CA only to
promote better competition and also considering account delivery requirement.

3.5.4 No Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) up to Rs. 200 crores23 shall be invited or such limit
as may be prescribed by the Department of Expenditure from time to time. In exceptional
cases where the Ministry or Department feels that there are special reasons for inviting GTE,
for tenders below such limit, it may record its detailed justification and seek prior approval for
relaxation from the Competent Authority specified by the Department of Expenditure.
a) The proposal for approval shall be submitted by Administrative Ministry with the
concurrence of Financial Advisor and approval of Secretary concerned. The proposals
submitted by individual offices/ organisation (e.g. autonomous bodies, Central Public
Sector Undertakings and subordinate offices of Central Government etc.) will not be
entertained.
b) The proposals shall be submitted along with duly filled format24 (placed at Annexure11).
3.5.5 Before sending the proposals for approvals of the Global Tenders, following is to be
ensured:a) Domestic open tender must be floated to identify the domestic manufacturers/ service
providers for the items/ services for which approval is being sought for issuance of
Global Tenders. In case, if the Ministry/ Department has not floated a domestic open
tender after 15.05.2020 for the items to be procured through GTE, such proposals will
not be entertained. The proposal must contain the details of domestic open tenders,
issued after 15.05.2020.These details shall cover tender number, date of opening,
number of offers received, details of offers received, reasons why domestic suppliers
were not considered etc.
b) The proposal must contain the details of deliberations with DPIIT/ relevant industrial
bodies for identification of domestic manufacturers/ service providers.
c) The 3/5-year procurement plan as mandated by Public Procurement (Preference to
Make in India) (PPP-MII) order issued by DPIIT must be published on website, before
forwarding proposals for the purpose of procurement through GTE. Web-link of
published procurement plan should be provided in proposal.

h) Without compromising quality, institutes should be flexible with specifications so that
domestic manufactures are encouraged to meet requirements.
3.5.7.2 Guidelines for resorting to GTE
a) Market assessment should be done by the concerned institution, as certified by the
Head of the Institution. Only after no Indian manufacturer is found, a GTE should be
issued.
b) In case no Indian manufacturer/ suppliers are found, procurement may be done,
through GTE, subject to compliance of provisions of GFR and requirement of
procurement through GeM.
c) DEAN (R&D) or an appropriate authority within the institute will issue certificates as
per para 3.5.7.3 below, before inviting GTE. As a reporting matter in the Board of
Governors, such certificates should be tabled, and also shared with Office of the PSA,
DPIIT and concerned Administrative Ministry.
d) The information about the procurement of equipment should be shared across various
Educational and Research Institutes, through the I-STEM portal, already established
for this purpose by the PSA’s office. This will allow the equipment to be used by other
institutions too, for research purposes.
e) Analyze the equipment being procured time and again from abroad, and help
developing them in India by identifying potential manufacturers and providing them
technical assistance and expertise for developing the equipment. Half yearly reports
on this action to be shared by the Institutes with the Office of the PSA, DPIIT and
concerned Administrative Ministry/ A national level scheme will also be initiated by the
Office of PSA for indigenous development of scientific equipment.
f) Preference to local suppliers over foreign supplier as per the existing Government of
India guidelines, should be observed as applicable.
3.5.7.3 Certificates to be issued

a) Confirmation of non-availability in India of particular equipment/ consumables of
foreign origin through GeM and other sources.
b) Certification that locally available alternatives with equivalent specifications are not
suitable for research purposes.
c) The non-availability of such equipment for research purposes with nearby research
institutes or within the institute.
d) Certification of the requirement of proprietary items of foreign origin for research
purposes (where applicable).

i)

LTE is a restricted competition procurement, where a preselected list of bidders
(enlisted with the Procuring Entity along with those enlisted with other Public Works
Organisations/ Works PSUs) is directly approached for bidding; bids from uninvited
bidders are treated as unsolicited and are normally not entertained, except in special
circumstances. This mode provides a short and simple procedure, but may not provide
as good a VfM as in case of open tendering – still a good balance for procurements
below a threshold. LTE procedures should be default mode of procurement when the
estimated value of procurement is less than Rs. five lakh or when limited numbers of

of their high complex or specialized nature, or for works of a secret nature

ii)

Terms and Conditions
a) Copies of the bidding documents should be sent free of cost (except in case
of priced specifications/ drawings) directly by speed post/ courier/ e-mail to
firms which are enlisted bidders/ contractors. Further, Procuring Entity should
also mandatorily publish its limited tender enquiries on Central Public
Procurement Portal (CPPP). Apart from CPPP, the organisations should
publish the tender enquiries on the Department’s or Ministry’s web site. The
unsolicited bids, if any should not be accepted; however Ministries/
Departments should evolve a system by which interested firms can enlist and
bid in next round of tendering. However, under the following exceptional
circumstances, these may be considered for acceptance at the next higher
level of competency:
1) Inadequate Competition
2) Non-availability of suitable quotations from enlisted bidders
3) Urgent demand and capacity/ capability of the firm offering the unsolicited
being known, etc.
b) A simplified Bid Document should be used, instead of a detailed Bid
Document. The minimum number of bidders to whom LTE should be sent is
more than three. In case less than three approved bidders/ contractors are
available, LTE may be sent to the available approved bidders/ contractors
with approval of the CA, duly recording the reasons. The requirement should
then be marked for development of more sources by the Bidder Enlistment
section.

LTE repeatedly. Audit should take up a
larger percentage of cases in LTE for review.
There is a risk that LTE may not attract
sufficient number of bids and sometimes
there may be a single acceptable offer. This
may be because of an insufficient database
of enlisted/ known vendors. It could also be
due to bid documents not reaching the
targeted bidders – intentionally or otherwise.
It could also be due to bidders not getting

limited tenders, with suitable clarifications
that unsolicited bids shall not be considered.

with relevant powers of approval etc.
Adequate time should be given for
submission of quotes, which should not be
less than three weeks. A longer period (six
weeks) could be given in case of import of
the materials and, in complex cases, if
justifications are given and allowed.
There is also a risk that the selection of
vendors may not be transparent. At the
evaluation stage, some invited bidders may
be passed over on grounds of being
ineligible/ unreliable.

All major procuring departments must keep
a list of enlisted bidders for use in restricted
bidding. Suppliers or contractors should be
selected in a non-discriminatory manner. All
past successful vendors/ bidders should
invariably be invited. In case it is proposed to
exclude any enlisted/ approved vendor/
contractor from being shortlisted for inviting
LTE, detailed reasons, such as failure in
supply, should be duly recorded and
approval of the CA be taken before
exclusion. The selection of bidders should
be with due diligence, to ensure that bidders
who do not meet eligibility criteria do not get
shortlisted. At the evaluation stage, in LTE,
passing over of a duly shortlisted bidder on
grounds of poor past performance or
eligibility may raise questions about
transparency.

3.5.11 33Single Tender Enquiry (STE) or Selection by Nomination

i)

The selection by direct negotiation/ nomination is called a single tender. This mode
may be shortest but since it may provide lesser VfM as compared to LTE/ OTE and
may also strain the transparency principle, it should be resorted to only under following
conditions:
a) There is an urgent need for the work and engaging in competitive tendering
process would, therefore, be impractical, provided that the circumstances giving
rise to the urgency were neither foreseeable by procuring entity nor the result of
dilatory conduct on its part.
b) Works that represent a natural continuation of previous work carried out by the
firm when considering the limited size of the additional work in relation to the
original procurement and the reasonableness of the price it will be cost effective
to resort to single source procurement. However, the incremental work should
not be more than 25 (twenty-five) percent of the original contract value;

33

Rule 166, GFR 2017

47

c) In case of an emergency situation, situations arising after natural disasters,
situations where timely completion of the work is of utmost importance subject to
the reason for such decision being recorded and approval of the competent
authority obtained.
d) Situations where execution of the work may involve use of proprietary techniques
or only one contractor has requisite expertise.
e) The procurement entity engages in procurement involving national defence or
national security and determines that single source procurement is the most
appropriate method of procurement.
f)

Under some special circumstances, it may become necessary to select a
particular Agency where adequate justification is available for such single-source
selection in the context of the overall interest of the Ministry or Department.

ii) Terms and Conditions
a)

The reasons for a STE and selection of a particular firm must be recorded and
approved by the CA as per the delegation of powers laid down at in DFPR/
SoPP, prior to single tendering. Powers of procurement of STE are more
restricted.

b)

The Procuring Entity shall ensure fairness and equity, and shall have a
procedure in place to ensure that: the prices are reasonable and consistent with
market rates for work of a similar nature; and the required work is not split into
smaller sized procurements.

c)

All works/purchase/ consultancy contracts awarded on nomination basis should
be brought to the notice of following authorities for information1.
2.

The Secretary, in case of ministries/departments.
The Board of directors or equivalent managing body, in case of Public
Sector Undertakings, Public Sector Banks, Insurance companies, etc;
3.
The Chief Executive of the organisation where such a managing body
is not in existence.
The report relating to such awards on nomination basis shall be submitted to the
Secretary/Board/Chief Executive /equivalent managing body, every quarter. The audit
committee or similar unit in the organisation may be required to check at least 10% of
such cases.]
3.5.12 STE - Risks and Mitigations
Risk

Mitigation

Risks as applicable in both LTE and OTE are
also applicable here. In addition there is a
risk that this mode may be used unjustifiably
to avoid open tendering (OTE).

All mitigation strategies of LTE and OTE
would apply here also. In addition the
systems of checks and balances should be
tighter by way of enhanced and severely
restricted delegation of powers in this regard
for certification of urgency and approval of
this mode of procurement. A system of
reports from the authority signing the

48

urgency certificate and post facto review of
utilisation of received goods/ works/ services
to tackle the expressed urgency may be laid
down. Audit should take up the bulk of such
cases for review to judge the genuineness of
urgency certification.
3.5.13 Award of Work through Quotations

i)

Use of quotations up to Rs Five lakh in each instance shall be adopted for procurement
of readily available goods that are not specially produced to the particular
specifications and for which there is an established market.

ii)

Procurement entity shall not divide its procurement into separate contracts to bring the
amount less than the amount set forth for such purpose.

iii)

Procurement entity shall request quotations from as many contractors as practicable
but positively from at least three contractors. Each contractor from whom a quotation
is requested, shall be informed whether any elements and other than the charges for
the goods themselves, such as, transportation and insurance charges, duties and
taxes are to be included in the price.

iv)

Each contractor or contractor is permitted to give only one price quotation and is not
permitted to change its quotation.

v)

Award of work through quotations shall be resorted only in emergent cases and
suitable reasons shall be recorded.

3.5.14 Award of works in stalled contracts: It is noted that in cases, where a contractor
abandons or stops the work mid-way, either due to insolvency or a dispute or other reason,
engagement of the new contractor takes considerable time and in the meanwhile public money
is locked up in assets which cannot be utilized, apart from inconvenience and loss of amenities
to the general public due to such half completed works.
Notwithstanding anything in the GFR or the Manual, procuring entities should devise methods
(including limited/ single tenders) to deal with part completed contracts, wherever the work is
abandoned by the contractor mid-way. However, for issuance of limited/single tenders in such
cases, at least 20% of work should have been billed by the contractor who has abandoned
the work. Procurement approval of such limited/single tender should be at the next higher
level, or such level as may be prescribed.
3.5.15 Back to Back Tie Up by PSUs: Construction PSUs while awarding the work will take
following points into consideration:
a) PSUs (when bag the contract from the client Department) as a contractor, has to execute
the work by functioning like a contractor instead of sub-letting the 100% work on back to back
basis.
b) Open tenders to be invited for selection of sub-contractors/pre-tender associate(s) as far
as possible.
c) In case, it is not possible to invite open tenders, selection should be carried out by inviting
limited tenders from the panel approved in the following manner. Panel of contractors are to

49

be prepared for different categories monetary limits, regions, in a transparent manner clearly
publishing the eligibility criteria etc. The above panel is to be updated every year.
d) Tenders to be opened confidentially by a high level committee to maintain the secrecy of
rates, if required. Tender opening register should be maintained in this regard duly signed by
the officers opening the tender and kept confidentially. This should be available for perusal
when required by audit/ vigilance.
e) The terms and conditions of the contract of the client especially those pertaining to
subletting of works should be strictly adhered to by the PSUs.
f) Adequate staff to be deployed by the PSUs to ensure quality in construction etc.
g) The record of enlistment/updation of contractor and tender opening register shall be
produced to the CTEO as well as audit officials when demanded for scrutiny.

Chapter 4: Preparing Bid Documents, Publication, Receipt and
Opening of Bids
4.1

Bid Documents

4.1.1 The text of the bid document should be self-contained and comprehensive without any
ambiguity. All essential information, which a bidder needs for sending responsive bid, should
be clearly spelt out in the bidding document in simple language. This will also enable the
prospective bidders to formulate and send their competitive bids with confidence. A carefully
prepared tender document avoids delays and complaints. Hence, it is worth spending time
and effort on this even in cases of urgency.
4.1.2 In case of a limited tender, instead of a full set of SBD, only a machine numbered
simplified tender form is used as the tender document, after filling up the name of the bidder
and details of requirements. It has the “terms and conditions of tender” printed on the obverse
side. In any case, all enlisted bidders, who normally are invited to quote in such limited tenders,
have already acknowledged acceptance of “general conditions of contract” as part of the
enlistment application, which are applicable to such procurements, in additions to “terms and
conditions of tender” on the obverse of tender form. If necessary, specifications and drawings
or any other document may be enclosed with the limited tender form.
4.1.3 While SBDs would be complete in itself and may be slightly different for various
categories of procurements, these must necessarily address the following essential aspects:

i) Description of the subject matter of procurement, its specifications including the nature,
quantity, time and location where the construction is to be effective, any incidental services
to be performed.;

ii) Limitation or preference for participation by bidders in terms of the government policies in
accordance with Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India), Order 2017 dated
28.05.2018 issued by Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion etc.);

iii) The criteria for eligibility and qualification to be met by the bidder (the eligibility criteria
should take care of the contractor’s eligibility to receive such a government contract). The
qualification criteria should take care of the contractor’s past performance, experience,
technical competence, financial strength to handle the contract successfully, compliance
with environmental protection regulations/ Environment Management System and so on;

iv) Requirements as to documentary evidence, which must be submitted by contractors or
contractors to demonstrate their qualifications.

v) The procedure for preparation and submission of tenders by the bidders including date,
time and place for obtaining, submitting and opening of the bids;

vi) Suitable provisions for enabling a bidder to seek clarification/ question the bidding
conditions, bidding process and/ or rejection of its bid. Names and contact details of IEM
in case of Integrity Pact;

vii) Criteria for determining the responsiveness of bids, criteria as well as factors to be taken
into account for evaluating the bids on a common platform and the criteria for awarding

51

the contract to the responsive, most advantageous (lowest/ highest as the case may be)
bidder should be clearly indicated in the bidding documents;

viii)Suitable provision for settlement of disputes, if any, emanating from the resultant contract,
should be kept in the bidding document; and

ix) Essential terms of the procurement contract including a suitable clause mentioning that
the resultant contract will be interpreted under Indian laws.

x) The names, designations and addresses of one or more officers or employees of the
procuring entity who are authorized to communicate directly with and to receive
communications directly from contractors or contractors in connection with the
procurement proceedings.

xi) Any formalities that will be required once a tender has been accepted for procurement
contract to enter into force.

xii) Tender Documents
a. The tender document is the fundamental document in the public procurement
process as after award of the contract it becomes part of the contract
agreement. All necessary provisions governing the contract should be clearly
provided in the tender document. Examples are technical specifications,
drawings, commercial terms and conditions including payment terms,
obligations of the procuring entity and the contractor timeframe/milestones for
execution of the project, tax implications, compliance framework for statutory
and other norms, reporting on progress/ quality of the work, dispute resolution.
Provisions/ clauses in the tender document should be clear to avoid differences
in interpretation and possible time overrun, cost overrun and quality
compromises. Comprehensive survey & solid investigation report, area grading
& mapping of underground facilities, where project is to be executed, may be
made available and made part of tender document. Model Tender Documents
issued by the DoE may be used, with due customisation.
b. In tenders containing General Conditions of Contract (GCC), additional/ special
conditions to be incorporated in the tender document, shall be need based and
specific. The GCCs should not be altered and changes, if any, in conditions of
contract should only be made through the Special Conditions of Contract.
c. Identification of milestones may be done in an optimal and sequential manner
and the same may be stipulated in the tender document along with enabling
provisions.
d. Payment terms prescribed in the tender document should be such that the
payment made to contractors at every stage is commensurate to quantum of
work done, subject to any requirements for initial mobilisation.
e. Procuring entities may issue instructions regarding appropriate delegation of
authority for approval of deviations, variations and changes in the scope of the
contract.
f. Provision of price variation, wherever considered appropriate, as well as
methodology for calculation of the same shall be clearly stipulated in the tender
document.

52

g. Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) may be incorporated in the tender document/
contract. Schedule of visit by various levels of officials should also form part of
the QAP.
h. Technical and Financial eligibility Criteria for the bidders are important in the
public procurement process. They shall be clear and fair, having regard to the
specific circumstances of the procurement. Appropriate parameters should be
prescribed in the eligibility criteria for bidders, to enable selection of the right
type of bidders in public interest, balancing considerations of quality, time and
cost.
i. Open online tendering should be the default method to ensure efficiency of
procurement. Public authorities should also keep the experience criteria broad
based so that bidders with experience in similar nature of works in various
sectors can participate.
j. Pre-bid conference may be conducted for large value tenders by Procuring
Entities. The Place and time of pre-bid conferences should be mentioned in
the tender document and/ or publicized through the website of the procuring
entity and/ or through newspaper publication. )

4.2

Preparation of Bid Documents by Procuring Entity

4.2.1 The bid documents must be based on relevant Standard Bidding Documents for the
Type of Contract (Lump Sum, Item Rate Etc); Estimated Value range, Bidding System (Single
Envelope/ Two Envelope/ PQB) etc. SBD for e-procurement would be slightly different from
the traditional SBD. To ensure uniformity, the standard provisions in most sections of the SBD
are to be used unaltered. Any modification to suit a unique requirement of the specific
procurement in these documents is to be done through variable sections such as Appendix to
Instructions to Bidders or Special Conditions of Contract (these variable sections may have
different nomenclatures in some organisations). Normally, if the organisation does not have
its own SBD, it may follow those of other Public Works Organisation like CPWD. Before
floating the tender the Bid Document should be got approved by the competent authority. The
contents of Bid Documents would therefore vary, but will generally comprise the following
(some of these sections may be named or organised differently in some organisations):
Volume 1

i) Notice Inviting Tenders (NIT)

Special Conditions of Contract (SCC):

Any additions, deletions, or variations to the GCC felt necessary for a particular project shall
be done by an appropriate entry in the SCC. Conditions of a special nature and project-specific
conditions shall be rationally incorporated. Special conditions shall be approved by the
authority competent to accept the tender. While drafting SCC, the circumstances warranting
them shall be duly considered, including but not limited to the following:
a) Where the wording in GCC specifically requires that further information is to be
included in SCC and the conditions would not be complete without that information;
b) Where the wording in GCC indicates that supplementary information may be included
in SCC, but the conditions would still be complete without that information;
c) Where the type, circumstances or locality of the works requires additional clauses or
sub-clauses; and
d) Where the laws of the country, or exceptional circumstances, necessitate alterations
in GCC. Such alterations are affected by stating in SCC that a particular clause, or part
of a clause in GCC, is deleted and giving the substitute clause or part, as applicable.
4.2.3

Bid Validity

A bid shall remain valid for the period mentioned in the ITB/ AITB [normally 90 (ninety) days
for OTE and 120 (one hundred and twenty) days for GTE]. In exceptional circumstances, the
consent of the bidder may be requested in writing for an extension to the period of bid validity.
Such requests should preferably be made much before the expiry of the bid validity. The bid
security provided shall also be suitably extended. A bidder accepting the request and granting
extension shall not be permitted to modify his bid.
Reasons for seeking extension of bid validity should be recorded by the procuring officers at
the time of taking such decisions itself.

4.3

Publication of Bid Documents

It is mandatory for all Ministries/ Departments of the Central Government, their attached and
Subordinate Offices and Autonomous /Statutory Bodies to publish their tender enquiries,
corrigenda thereon and details of bid awards on the Central Public Procurement Portal
(CPPP)34. If the department has its own website/ e-Procurement Portal, it should also publish
all its advertised tender enquiries on such website/ Portal also. GFR 2017 has dispensed with
advertisements in Newspapers. However, in exceptional circumstances, procuring entities
may issue the advertisement in newspapers as deemed fit. Such advertisement should also
consist of the link of website from where the detailed advertisement and bidding document
can be seen and downloaded. Individual cases where confidentiality is required, for reasons

34

Rule 159, GFR 2017

54

of national security, would be exempted from the mandatory e-publishing requirement. The
decision to exempt any case on the said grounds should be approved by the Secretary of the
Ministry/ Department with the concurrence of the concerned Financial Advisor. In the case of
Autonomous Bodies and Statutory Bodies’ approval of the Head of the Body with the
concurrence of the Head of the Finance should be obtained in each such case. Statistical
information on the number of cases in which exemption was granted and the value of the
concerned contract should be intimated on a Quarterly basis to the Ministry of Finance,
Department of Expenditure. In order to promote wider participation and ease of bidding, no
cost of tender document may be charged for the tender documents downloaded by the
bidders. To ensure competition, attention of all likely tenderers, for example, enlisted vendors,
past contractors and other known potential contractors, should be invited to the NIT through
email/ SMSs/ letters. In e-procurement, the website may be programmed to generate these
alerts automatically. In case of procurement through a limited tender, the NIT may be uploaded
on CPPP Portal and Procuring Entity’s website with a note saying:
“This notice is being published for information only and is not an open invitation to quote in
this limited tender. Participation in this tender is by invitation only and is limited to the selected
Procuring Entity’s enlisted contractors. Unsolicited offers are liable to be ignored. However,
contractors who desire to participate in such tenders in future may apply for enlistment with
Procuring Entity as per procedure.”
Printouts of the tenders published on the website should be collected and kept on record as a
proof of publicity. The complete details of the dates, on which advertisements actually
appeared on the website, should be indicated while sending cases to higher authorities.
In order to increase certainty in the procurement process, all Ministries/Departments shall fix
days in every month for issuance of Notice Inviting Tender (NIT), and Tender Opening across
various locations, divisions or levels. For example, the tenders may be released by the
Ministries/Departments three times a month, i.e., on 10th, 20thand 30th of every month and the
bid submission dates are so determined that bids are opened only on fixed scheduled dates,
viz, 7th, 17thand 27thof every month. In case there are practical difficulties due to large volume
of tenders in having fixed days across the whole organisation, the
Ministries/Departments/CPSUs may decide to have region-wise, zone-wise, or division-wise
fixed days for issuance of NIT and Opening of Tenders. For procurement of highly
technological and complex works, tender submission dates may be extended by the
Ministries/Departments/CPSUs in order to reply queries in the pre-bid meetings or any other
justifiable reason. For example, CPWD, which is a large procurer of works have region-wise
fixed days for issuance of NITs and opening of tenders as per the following table:

Days for Tender Opening

(i) One week in the case of works with estimated cost put to tender up to Rs.2 crore and two weeks
in the case of works with estimated cost more than Rs.2 crore. If there is holiday on a particular
day, the day of inviting/uploading NIT may be proposed to earlier day and opening of tender may
be postponed to next day.
(ii) However, in case of exigencies of work, the Chief Engineer/Chief Project Manager or equivalent
can allow to call and open tenders on another day instead of specific fixed days.

4.4

Issue/ Availability and Cost of tender documents

The sale/ availability for downloading of tender documents against NIT should not be
restricted. Tender documents should preferably be sold/ available for download up to the date
of opening of tenders. The organization should also post the complete tender document in its
web site and on CPPP to enable prospective tenderers to make use of the document
downloaded from the web site. The advertisement for invitation of tenders should give
complete web-address from where bid documents can be downloaded. The procuring entity
shall maintain proper records about the number of tender documents sold, list of parties to
whom sold, details of the amount received through sale and, also, the number of unsold tender
documents, which are to be cancelled after the opening of the tenders.

4.5

Eligibility and Qualifications of Bidders

4.5.1

Eligibility of Bidders

i)

All eligible bidders meeting the eligibility criteria as defined in ITB can participate in the
tender. The applicant should be a private or government-owned legal entity.

ii)

Bidder should have valid registration with Employees Provident Fund organization
under ‘EPF and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952’.

iii)

For package size exceeding certain values [say - Rs. 10 (ten) crore], Joint Ventures
may be allowed. Maximum number of partners in JV shall be limited (say – three). In
case of JV, all the partners shall be jointly and severally liable for the successful
completion of the work.

iv)

A firm that has been engaged by Ministry/ Department to provide consultancy services
for the preparation or implementation of a project, and any of its affiliates (associates,
subsidiary, JV partner), shall not be eligible for subsequently providing goods or works
(other than a continuation of the firm's earlier consultancy services) for the same
project.

v)

A firm determined non-performing by the Procuring Entity shall not be eligible to bid
during the period so determined.

vi)

The bidder must not have in his employment:

4.5.2

a)

The near relations (defined as first blood relations, and their spouses, of the
bidder or the bidder's spouse) of persons involved in decision making in the
procurement as listed in the Appendix to ITB.

b)

Without Government permission, any person who retired as gazetted officer
within the last two years of the rank and from the departments listed in the
Appendix to ITB.

Qualification of Bidders

56

Qualification of bidders is done on Pre-qualification Bidding basis (refer Para 3.3.6, PQB) or
on post-qualification basis (refer Para 3.3.4, single stage multiple envelope system). In both
cases Qualification criteria needs to be laid down in the Bid Document (refer para 3.3.6 iii).It
is of utmost importance to develop new contractors and also to provide avenues to Subcontractors, since they may not get opportunities to accumulate the required credentials to
compete in normal tenders. To enable a window of entry for such Start-ups and subcontractors, in small value contracts (e.g. repair contracts upto Rs. 30 lakh) the requirements
regarding General Construction Experience, Particular Construction Experience and Available
Bid Capacity may not be insisted upon provided the bidders fulfil other criteria regarding
Financial/ Personnel/ Equipment capabilities [refer para 3.3.6 (iii)]. However to avoid
overstretching of their resources, no such contractors may be allowed to hold more than 2
contracts under relaxed credentials, at any given time.

4.6

Clarification of Tender Documents

A prospective bidder requiring clarification on the tender documents may notify the Procuring
Entity in writing, well before the due date of submission of bids, and a response must be sent
in writing regarding the clarifications sought prior to the date of opening of the tenders. Copies
of the query of any bidder and clarification issued must be sent to all prospective bidders who
have received the tender documents. There shall be no asymmetry of information as regard
to any bidder.

4.7

Amendment of Tender Documents

At any time prior to the date of submission of bids, the Procuring Entity may, whether at his
own initiative or in response to a clarification sought by a prospective bidder, amend bid
documents by issuing a corrigendum. The corrigendum shall be notified in writing by registered
post/ speed post/ courier/ email to all known prospective bidders and shall be published on
CPPP. Copies of such amendments are also to be prominently attached in the unsold sets of
the tender documents (which are available for sale, if any), including the tender documents
uploaded on the website. When the amendment/ modification changes the requirement
significantly and/ or when there is not much time left for the tenderers to respond to such
amendments, it is better to prepare a revised tender and the time and date of submission of
tenders are also to be extended suitably. Depending on the situation, such an amendment
may also need fresh publication adopting the same procedure as for publication of the original
tender enquiry. This is very critical as the amendment may lead to any new bidder meeting
the qualifying criteria and publicity is required to ensure a level playing field.

4.8

Pre-bid Conference

In case of turnkey contract(s) or contract(s) of special nature for procurement of sophisticated
and costly work/ services/ equipment or wherever felt necessary, a suitable provision is to be
kept in the bidding documents for inviting the bidders or their official representatives to attend
one or more pre-bid conference at a specified place and time, for clarifying issues and clearing
doubts, if any, about the specifications/ Terms of Reference and other allied technical/
commercial details of the work, services, plant, equipment and machinery etc.
Bidders should be asked to submit written queries in advance of the conference. After the
conference, Minutes of the pre-bid meeting including all the questions and replies shall be
prepared and approved by the competent authority. In order to bring clarity to replies, all
questions/ answers and needed amendments should be merged in the sequence of clauses
in the bidding document. It is a good practice to consolidate all queries received either as part
of pre-bid meeting or just after issuing bidding documents and deal with in a comprehensive

57

way. Minutes of the meeting, including the text of the questions raised and the responses
given, shall be transmitted without delay to all purchasers of the bidding documents. The
techno-commercial requirements may be revised if considered necessary by way of issue of
a formal corrigendum (mere minutes of the meeting of pre-bid conference would not suffice)
and shared with all the bidders who purchase or have purchased the bid documents. These
pre-bid minutes shall be published along with the bid documents on the appropriate website
including CPPP. After the issue of clarifications/ modifications consequent to the pre-bid
meeting, at least two clear weeks should be given for submission of bids.

4.9

Submission of Bids by Bidders

4.9.1 The procuring entity shall fix a place and a specific date and time as the deadline for

58

4.9.1A. Quality-cum-cost based Selection (QCBS) for works and Non-Consultancy
Services:
i)

Procuring entities are hereby allowed to use QCBS for procurement of works and
non-consultancy services in the following cases:
a.
b.

Where the procurement has been declared to be a Quality Oriented
Procurement (QOP) by the competent authority or
For procurement of Non-Consulting Services, where estimated value of
procurement (including all taxes and option clause does not exceed Rs. 10
crore.

Note: In cases where estimated value was less than Rs. 10 crore but, on tendering, following
QCBS process, it is proposed to place contract for more than Rs. 10 crores, the following
procedure shall be adopted:

ii)

iii)

1. In case the difference between estimated value (including taxes etc as above) and
value of the proposed contract (including taxes etc) is less than 10% of the
estimated value, there will be no bar on placement of contract.
2. In all other cases, the procurement process is to be scrapped and restarted either
as QOP or on n on QCBS basis.
The principles of QCBS shall be as provided in Rule 192(i), (ii) and (iii) of the GFR.
However, the maximum weight of the non-financial parameters shall in no case exceed
30%. The Competent Authority for allowing QCBS shall be as follows:a. For declaring a procurement as QOP:
1. Where the procuring entity/project executing authority is covered by Rule 1
of GFR, the secretary of the Ministry/Department, to which the procuring
entity belongs.
2. Where the procuring entity is a CPSE, the Board of Directors of the CPSE.
b. For Non-consulting Services not exceeding Rs. 10 crore in value:
1. Where the procuring entity is covered by Rule 1 of GFR, by the officer or
authority two levels above the officer/authority competent to finalize the
particular procurement, or the Secretary of the Ministry/Department
whichever is lower.
2. Where the procuring enrity is a CPSE, the authority or officer two levels
above the officer competent to finalize the particular procurement, or the
Board of Directors of the CPSE whichever is lower.
In all cases of QOP, a Special Technical Committee (STC) shall be constituted with
the following composition:a.
Two or more persons who have expert knowledge and /o9r long experience
relevant to the procurement in question;
b.
One or more persons with extensive experience in handling public projects
and/or public finance in the Government or State/Central Public Sector;
c.
One or more persons with experience in financial management/financial
administration/audit/accountancy;
d.
Note more than one member representing the procuring entity who may inter
alia provide administrative support to the Committee.
e.
The persons referred to in sub paras (i) to (iii) shall be persons not working
under the Competent Authority specified in para 2 (15.2.2) and shall not belong

59

to any organization under the control of, or receiving funding from, the procuring
entity or the Ministry/Department to which such procuring entity belongs.
iv) The names of members of the Special Technical Committee shall be decided either by
the Competent Authority specified in para 2(15.2.2) above or by any other authority to
whom such power is delegated by the competent authority; however, powers shall not be
delegated to the officer or authority competent to finalize the particular procurement.
Sitting fee may be paid to the members of the STC. Incidental costs including travel be
paid by the procuring entity.
The STC shall make specific recommendations on the following matters:a.
The weight to be given to non-financial parameters (not exceeding 30%).
b.
The specific quality/technical parameters, their weights, their scoring
methodology, the minimum qualification score etc. and other relevant criteria
necessary for enduring fair and transparent quality/technical evaluation of the
bids.
v) The recommendations of the STC shall be followed except where there are special
grounds in public interest for deviating from them. However, every case of deviation from
the recommendations of the STC shall require approval of the Competent Authority
specified in para 2( 15.2.2)(i) above who approved the declaration of the procurement as
QOP.
vi) In respect of QCBS for Non-Consultancy Services not exceeding Rs. 10 crore, a
Technical Committee shall be constituted to carry out functions mentioned in para 5(
15.2.5) in lieu of the STC. The composition of the Technical Committee shall follow the
provisions of para 3(15.2.3)(vi) shall however not be applicable in such cases.
vii) Grounds for Declaring a Procurement to be Quality Oriented Procurement: A procurement
should be declared as a QOP only if there is enough justification in terms of value addition
or enhancement of delivery or paramount importance of quality. Reasons for not adopting
two cover/prequalification-based/least cost system shall be documented.
viii) Tender Documents-Fixing/Selection of the Evaluation/Qualification Criteria
a.
To ensure quality, some of the criteria used in marking may be made
mandatory and if a bidder does not meet those, then bids shall not be evaluated
further.
b.
Weightage may also be given for timely completion of past projects of similar
nature by the bidder.
c.
In all cases of QOP, a pre-bid meeting shall be held in which the technical
criteria including the marking scheme shall be discussed with the potential
bidders. If any changes in the criteria are necessitated by such consultation
such changes shall require the recommendation of the STC. In NonConsultancy Services, pre-bid meetings may be held at the discretion of the
public authority.
ix)
Fixing of Scoring/Marketing Criteria:
a.
The coring should not be a variable that relies on the subjective opinion of the
evaluating panel. The marking scheme should enable achievement of almost
similar cores irrespective of the persons/experts being involved in the
evaluation process. When the outcome are consistent for the available
information, the QCBS parameters are more reliable. Unambiguous description
and criteria help to avoid grey areas so as to endure that there is only one
possible score for the item. As far as possible, the criteria should be so specific
and clear that bidders can self-mark their own bids.

60

b.
c.

d.

e.

f.

It is better to specify minimum marks for meeting the qualifying criteria
specified.
Examples of fixed quality parameters that ought not to be considered for
relative scoring including organizations’ ISO/standards accreditation,etc.These
are required to establish the credentials of the service provider but cannot be
used for relative comparison between the various bidders.
Bidders should be asked to produce certificates for the past performance. A
format may be given in the tender itself outlining the contract details,
completion, sustainability of service, etc. and bidders may be asked to fill it and
give evidence to that effect.
Bidders may be askedto submit a detailed presentationon their proposals in the
form of soft copy along with the bid so as to facilitate better understanding of
their proposal and to ensure commitment.
Besides the Bill of Quantity (BOQ) output criteria for payment, Key
Performance Indicators (KPI) may be specified with minimum achievement
levels for payment so as to ensure quality compliance.

x) Evaluation of QCBS Bids: For evaluation, a suitable committee shall be constituted.
However, members of the STC shall not be involved.
xi) Joint Ventures in QCBS
a. In conventional tenders, some bidders adopt ‘name borrowing’ and
Joint Ventures(JV) often do not function in letter and spirit. This
results in lack of quality and accountability. JVs often end in onesided participation, diluting the essence of the tender evaluation
during its performance. Since quality is given weightage in the
evaluation itself, in QCBS procurement, it is even more important to
guard against such tendencies. Therefore, Joint Ventures may be
avoided in QCBS procurements as far as possible. Joint Ventures
could, however, become necessary in high technology or innovative
projects where a single entity may not be able to execute the work
alone.
b. If JVs are allowed, adequate safeguards should be provided. Since
weightage for quality/ experience influences the award itself,
measure should be taken to ensure that all the JV partners are
present and deliver services all through the contract period. An
Implementation Board with participation of all JV partners may be
provided for wherein the Project Manager from the procuring entity
shall also be allowed audience when required. Meeting of JV
partners with the project executing authority for quarterly progress
review may be made as a criterion linked to achievement of key
dates or even payment.
Note: In para 4.9.1A instructions containing “shall” are mandatory; any deviation from these
instructions shall require relaxation from Ministry of Finance (for Ministries/ Departments etc.)
or from the Board of Directors (for Central Public Sector Enterprises).
4.9.2 Sealing and Marking of Tenders
The tender document is to indicate the total number of tender sets (e.g., in duplicate or in
triplicate etc) required to be submitted. In case bids are asked in a number of copies, the

61

tenderer is to seal the original and each copy of the tender in separate envelopes, duly marking
the same as “original”, “duplicate” and so on and also marking these as mentioned above. In
case of two envelope bidding system, the techno-commercial bid and financial bid should be
sealed by the tenderer in separate inner covers duly marking these as ‘Techno-commercial
Bid’ and ‘Financial Bid’ and marked with the address of the purchase office and the tender
reference number on the envelopes. Further, the sentence ‘’NOT TO BE OPENED”
before……….. (due date & time of tender opening) are also to be put on these envelopes and
these sealed inner covers are to be put in a bigger outer cover which should also be sealed
and duly super scribed in a similar manner. If the outer envelope is not sealed and marked
properly as above, the Procuring Entity will not assume any responsibility for its misplacement,
premature opening, late opening etc. These details regarding the submission of bids should
also form a part of the ITB and AITB in the tender documents; all the above instructions are to
be suitably incorporated in the tender documents.
4.9.3

Withdrawal, Substitution and Modification of Tenders

The tenderer, after submitting the tender, is permitted to withdraw, substitute or modify the
tenders in writing without forfeiture of Bid Security/ EMD, provided these are received duly
sealed and marked like the original tender, up to the date and time of receipt of the tender.
Any such request received after the prescribed date and time of receipt of tenders will not be
considered. No bid may be withdrawn in the interval between the deadline for submission of
bids and expiration of the period of bid validity. Withdrawal of a bid during this period will result
in forfeiture of the bidder’s bid security (EMD) and other sanctions.

4.10

Receipt and Opening of Bids

The tender received by the procuring entity after the deadline for the submission of tender,
shall not be opened and shall be returned to the contractors or contractors that submitted it.
No submission is allowed in e-Procurement after the submission deadline.
On the due date and appointed time, as mentioned in the bid document, the Bid Opening
Committee (BOC - comprising one officer each from the procuring entity and Associated/
integrated Finance) will open the bids in the presence of the intending bidders or their
representative. The bidder’s name, the bid prices and conditional and unconditional discount,
if any will be announced by the procuring entity during opening of bids. A record of opening of
bids will be maintained, including signatures of bidders present.
In e-procurement, all tenders uploaded by tenderers are received, safeguarded and opened
online on the portal as detailed in Appendix 3. In offline tenders, receipt and custody of bids
shall be done in a transparent manner to maintain the credibility of the process. The following
guidelines should be adhered to for receipt and custody of bids:

i)

The procuring entity shall maintain tender boxes for receiving the bids at suitable
locations which would facilitate security and easy access to bidders. If required, Tender
boxes should be separate for each day of the week of tender opening and should be
sealed by the Bid Opening Committee (BOC) of the day. The tender box shall have
two locks. Key of one lock will be with the head of the office and the other key with the
official nominated by him;

ii)

Bids received by courier shall be deposited in the tender box by the Dispatch Section
till the date and time of bid opening. Bids sent by telex, cable or facsimile are to be
ignored and rejected.; and

62

iii)

For bulky/ oversized bids which cannot be dropped into tender boxes, the officials
authorised to receive such bids shall maintain proper records and provide a signed
receipt with date and time to the bearer of the bid. He will also sign on the cover, duly
indicating the date and time of receipt of the tender(s). Names and designations of at
least two such authorised officers should be mentioned in the bid documents

iv)

The authorised representatives of bidders, who intend to attend the tender opening in
OTE/ GTE, are to bring with them letters of authority from the corresponding bidder.
The prescribed format for the letter of authority for attending the bid opening should be
given in the bidding document. All bid-opening activities should be carried out
demonstrably before such a gathering. The prescribed format for the bid opening
attendance sheet and report are given at Annexure 2;

v)

At a prescheduled date and time, the BOC of the day should get the particular tender
box opened, after ensuring and demonstrating that the seal on the box has not been
tampered with. All bids should be collected from the tender box. Bids for tenders not
opening on that day should be put back into the box and the box resealed. Sometimes,
there would be tenders dropped wrongly into this tender box. Such wrongly dropped
tenders with appropriate endorsement should be put into the appropriate box or sent
to the Tender Committee (TC) concerned, if the date of opening is over. The bids for
different tenders opening on the day (including oversized bids, which were submitted
to designated officers) should be sorted, and a count for each tender should be
announced and recorded, particularly noting any modifying/ altering/ withdrawal of
bids. BOC should ensure and demonstrate that bid envelopes are duly sealed and untampered. Late bids should be separately counted but kept aside and not opened. In
the case of an advertised tender enquiry or limited tender enquiry, late bids (that is,
bids received after the specified date and time for receipt of bids) should not be
considered;

vi)

After opening, every tender shall be numbered serially (say 3/ 14 – if it is the third bid
out of 14 total), initialled, and dated on the first page by the BOC. Each page of the
price schedule or letter attached to it shall also be similarly initialled, particularly the
prices, delivery period, and so on, which shall also be circled and initialled along with
the date. Any other page containing significant information should also be dealt with
similarly. Blank tenders, if any, should be marked accordingly by the BOC. The original
(and duplicate, if any) copies in a tender set are to be marked accordingly by the BOC.
As the bids are to be submitted in hardbound form, signing of covering letters and index
page by all the committee members is sufficient;

vii)

Erasure/ cutting/ overwriting/ use of whitener/ columns left unfilled in tenders, if any,
shall be initialled along with date and time and numbered by the officials opening the
tenders and total number of such noticed alterations (or the absence of any
alteration)should be explicitly marked on the first page of the bid. Wherever quantity/
amount is written only in figures, the BOC should write them in words. All rebates/
discounts should be similarly circled, numbered and signed. In the absence of any
alteration/ overwriting/ whitener/ blanks, the remark “no corrections noted” should be
written. Similarly, the absence of discounts should be marked with “no discounts
noted;”

63

viii)

The BOC is to announce the salient features of the tenders such as description and
specification of the goods, quoted price, terms of delivery, delivery period, discount, if
any, whether EMD furnished or not, and any other special feature of the tender for the
information of the representatives attending the tender opening. No clarifications by
tenderers should be entertained or allowed to be recorded during the bid opening. It
should be understood that BOC has no authority to reject any tender at the tender
opening stage;

ix)

A bid opening report containing the names of the tenderers (serial number wise),
salient features of the tenders, as read out during the public opening of tenders, will be
prepared by the tender opening officers, and duly signed by them along with the date
and time. The tenders that have been opened, list of the representatives attending the
tender opening, and bid opening report are to be handed over to the nominated
purchase officer and an acknowledgement obtained for him.

4.11

Bid Security/ Earnest Money Deposit (EMD)

To safe guard against a bidder’s with drawing or altering its bid during the bid validity period
in the case of OTE and GTE tenders, bid security [also known as Earnest Money Deposit
(EMD)] is to be obtained from the bidders along with their bids. Any bid not accompanied by
the requisite bid security shall be rejected as non-responsive in accordance with provisions of
the bidding document. The amount of bid security should generally be between two to five per
cent of the estimated value of the goods to be procured. The amount of bid security, rounded
off to the nearest thousands of Rupees, as determined by the Procuring Entity, is to be
indicated in the bidding documents.
The Bid Security may be obtained in the form of Insurance Surety Bonds 35, account payee
demand draft, fixed deposit receipt, banker’s cheque or Bank Guarantee from any of the
Commercial Banks or payment online in an acceptable form, safeguarding the purchaser’s
interest in all respects. The bid security is normally to remain valid for a period of 45 (fortyfive) days beyond the final bid validity period.
In appropriate cases, in place of a Bid security, Procuring Entities may consider asking Bidders
to sign a Bid securing declaration accepting that if they withdraw or modify their Bids during
the period of validity, or if they are awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract, or
to submit a performance security before the deadline defined in the request for bids/ request
for proposals document, they will be suspended for the period of time specified in the request
for bids/ request for proposals document from being eligible to submit Bids/ Proposals for
contracts with the procuring entity.
In appropriate cases, Submission of the bid security may be waived with the Competent
Authority’s (CA’s) approval in the case of indigenisation/ development tenders, limited tenders
and Single Tender.
Bid securities of the unsuccessful bidders should be returned at the earliest after expiry of the
final bid validity period and latest by the 30th day after the award of the contract. Bid security
should be refunded to the successful bidder on receipt of a performance security. However,
in case of two packet or two stage bidding, Bid securities of unsuccessful bidders during first

35

Notified vide OM No. F.1/1/2022-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 02.02.2022

64

stage i.e. technical evaluation etc. should be returned within 30 days of declaration of result
of first stage i.e. technical evaluation etc.36
A bidder’s bid security will be forfeited if the bidder
i)

withdraws or amends its/ his tender;

ii) impairs or derogates from the tender in any respect within the period of validity of
the tender;
iii) If the bidder does not accept the correction of his bid price during evaluation; and
iv) If the successful bidder fails to sign the contract or furnish the required performance
security within the specified period.

4.12

Performance Guarantee

i)

To ensure due performance of the contract, performance security [or Performance
Bank Guarantee (PBG)] is to be obtained from the successful bidder awarded the
contract. Performance security should be for an amount of five (5) to ten (10) per cent
of the value of the contract. [The value has been reduced to three (3) percent till
31.03.2023. Refer to para 4.12 (iv) below]. In works contract it is usual to take five
percent of contract value Performance Security. Performance security may be
furnished in the form of Insurance Surety Bond37, account payee demand draft, fixed
deposit receipt from a commercial bank, bank guarantee issued/ confirmed from any
of the commercial bank in India or online payment in an acceptable form, safeguarding
the Procuring Entity's interest in all respects. In case of a JV, the BG towards
performance security shall be provided by all partners in proportion to their participation
in the project. In case of GTE tenders, the performance security should be in the same
currency as the contract and must conform to Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees
(URDG 758) – an international convention regulating international securities 38 .
Submission of Performance Security is not necessary for a contract value upto Rs. one
lakh.

ii)

Performance Security is to be furnished by a specified date [generally 21 (twenty-one)
days after notification of the award] and it should remain valid for a period of 60 (sixty)
days beyond the date of completion of all contractual obligations of the contractor,
including Defect Liability Period (DLP).

iii)

The performance security will be forfeited and credited to the procuring entity’s account
in the event of a breach of contract by the contractor. It should be refunded to the
contractor without interest, after he duly performs and completes all obligations under
the contract but not later than 365 days of completion of the Defect Liability Period
(DLP). Return of Bid/ Performance Securities should be monitored and delays should
be avoided. If feasible, the details of these securities may be listed in the eProcurement Portal, so as to make the process transparent and visible.

rules for independent guarantees and counter-guarantees among trading partners for securing payment and
performance in worldwide commercial contracts.
37

65

iv)

On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, that caused slowdown in economy, it is
decided to reduce Performance Security from existing five to ten percent to three (3)
percent of the value of the contract for all existing contracts till 31.03.2023. However,
the benefit of the reduced Performance Security will not be given in the contracts under
dispute wherein arbitration/ court proceedings have been already started or are
contemplated. All tenders/ contracts issued/ concluded till 31.03.2023 should also
have the provision of reduced Performance Security. In all contracts, where
Performance Security has been reduced to three percent, the reduced percentage
shall continue for the entire duration of the contract and there should be no subsequent
increase of Performance Security even beyond 31.03.2023. Similarly, in all contracts
entered into with the reduced percentage of Performance Security of three percent,
there will be no subsequent increase in Performance Security even beyond
31.03.2023. Where, there is compelling circumstances to ask for Performance Security
in excess of three percent as stipulated above, the same should be done only with the
approval of the next higher authority to the authority competent to finalise the particular
tender, or the Secretary of the Ministry/ Department, whichever is lower. Specific
reasons justifying the exception shall be recorded39.

4.13

Security Deposit/ Retention Money

In addition to Performance Security (usually five percent), Contracts for works usually provide
for a percentage (usually five percent) of each running bill (periodic/ interim payment) to be
withheld as Security Deposit/ retention money until final acceptance. The earnest money
instead of being released may form part of the security deposit. The contractor may, at his
option, replace the retention amount with an unconditional BG from a bank acceptable to the
Procuring Entity at the following stages:
i)

After the amount reaches half the value of the limit of retention money; and

ii)

After the amount reaches the maximum limit of retention money. One-half of the
retention money (or BG, which replaced retention money) shall be released on the
issue of the taking-over certificate; if the Taking Over Certificates (TOCs) are issued in
parts, then in such proportions as the engineer may determine, having regard to the
value of such part or section. The other half of the retention money (or BG, which
replaced the retention money) shall be released upon expiration of 365 days after the
DLP of the works or final payment, whichever is earlier, on certification by the engineer.
In the event of different defect liability periods being applicable to different sections or
parts, the expiration of defect liability period shall be the latest of such periods.

4.14

Sources and Verification of Bank Guarantees

Bank Guarantee for Bid Security (EMD) or Performance Guarantee (Security Deposit) should
be irrevocable and operative Bank Guarantee (BG) as per format enclosed in the Bid
Document and should be issued by a Scheduled Commercial (i.e. Indian or Foreign Banks
included in the Second Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 excluding Co-operative
banks or Regional Rural Banks). In case of foreign bidders or in case of GTE, if Bank
Guarantee is from a foreign bank branch situated outside India, the Bank Guarantee must be
issued through any of the Scheduled Commercial Bank. In case BG is issued directly by a
bank outside India, it should be executed on Letter Head of the Bank and should be advised
and made payable through their Indian Branch/Corresponding Bank in India. The Issuing Bank
39

Notified vide OM No.F.9/4/2020-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 30.12.2021

66

should also state the name and designation of the next Higher Authority of the Officials who
have issued the Bank Guarantee.
Bank guarantees submitted by the tenderers/ contractors as EMD/ performance securities
need to be immediately verified from the issuing bank before acceptance. There may not be
any need to get the Bank Guarantee vetted from legal/ finance authority if it is in the specified
format. Guidelines for verification of BGs submitted by the bidders/ contractors against EMD/
performance security/ advance payments and for various other purposes are as follows:
i)

BG shall be as per the prescribed formats

ii) The BG contains the name, designation and code number of the Bank officer(s)
signing the guarantee(s);
iii) The address and other details (including telephone no.) of the controlling officer of
the bank are obtained from the branch of the bank issuing the BG (this should be
included in all BGs);
The confirmation from the issuing branch of the bank is obtained in writing though registered
post/ speed post/ courier. The bank should be advised to confirm the issuance of the BGs
specifically quoting the letter of Procurement Entity on the printed official letterhead of the
bank indicating address and other details (including telephone nos.) of the bank and the name,
designation and code number of the officer(s) confirming the issuance of the BG;
Pending receipt of confirmation as above, confirmation can also be obtained with the help of
responsible officer at the field office, which is close to the issuing branch of the bank, who
should personally obtain the confirmation from issuing branch of the bank and forward the
confirmation report to the concerned procurement entity.
As far as possible organizations should follow e-verification of bank guarantees as per the
procedure prescribed by Reserve Bank of India.
Bank guarantees, either received in physical form or electronic form, should be verified for its
genuineness following prescribed method for the same and the Organisations should do due
diligence on genuineness of the Bank Guarantees before acceptance of the same.

4.15

Safe Custody and Monitoring of Securities

A suitable mechanism for safe custody and monitoring of EMDs and performance securities
and other instruments should be evolved and implemented by each ministry/ department. The
ministries/ departments shall also make institutional arrangements for taking all necessary
actions on time for extension or encashment or refund of EMDs and performance securities,
as the case may be. Monitoring should also include a monthly review of all bank guarantees
and other instruments expiring in next three months, along with a review of the progress of the
corresponding contracts. Extension of bank guarantees and other instruments, where
warranted, should be sought immediately and implemented within their validity period. Bank
Guarantee should never be handed over to the contractor for propose of extension of validity.
Such a system of monitoring of securities and other instruments may be considered to be
computerised with automatic alerts about lapse of validity etc. For release of BGs, the proposal
shall be forwarded by the executing agency with its recommendations in accordance with the
contract conditions, for approval by the CA with the concurrence of the Finance Division.

4.16

Goods and Services Tax (GST)

67

i)

A detailed clause regarding GST may be included in the bid documents, in consultation
with the Financial Advisor, stipulating inter-alia that all the bidders/ tenders should
ensure that they are GST compliant and their quoted tax structure /rates are as per
GST Law. While before enactment of GST, the bid prices were normally inclusive of
applicable taxes, now after its enactment, as per the GST Act the bid and contract
must show the GST Tax Rates and GST Amount explicitly and separate from the bid/
contract price (exclusive of GST). Asking for a bid-price inclusive of taxes/ GST would
be a violation of the GST Act. Bid format may be suitably modified accordingly. In the
transition period, any variation in tax structure/rate due to introduction of GST shall be
dealt with under Statutory Variation Clause.

Ministries/ Departments may follow the procedure as mentioned below while dealing
with contractor’s payment, post GST promulgation:

a) Works is treated as a ‘Service’. (- GST rate would vary depending on type of
work). All works contracts are to be provided with Harmonized System of
Nomenclature - HNS Code (actually Service Accounting Code SAC, being a
service). The HNS code can be downloaded from the website www.cbec.gov.in.
Works Contracts in general come under Chapter 99, Section 5, Heading
9954(Construction Services)as ‘Composite supply of Works contract as defined in
clause40 119 of section 2 of CGST Act’.GST rate would be based on the type of
contract. In case contract consists of both goods & service, then interpretation
regarding nature of contract should be done as per clause41 8, Chapter III of CGST
Act, 2017.

b) The ‘on account/ final contract certificate’ shall be prepared by the Ministry/
Department on the basis of quantity of work executed at the contracted rates, duly
segregating the GST component as detailed in para (iii) below.

c) Since before promulgation of GST, the contracted rates normally used to be
inclusive of all taxes, the calculation of ‘Gross amount of work executed’, ‘Amount
of work executed excluding GST amount’ and ‘GST amount’ in the ‘on account /
final contract certificate’ may be done as under:
Let Z = Gross amount of work executed on the basis of quantum of work executed at the
contracted rates.
R = Percentage rate of GST for that HSN code
Y = GST amount as per applicable GST rate for that HSN code.
X - Amount of work executed excluding GST amount.
Then, Z = X + Y;

40

(119) “works contract” means a contract for building, construction, fabrication, completion, erection,
installation, fitting out, improvement, modification, repair, maintenance, renovation, alteration or
commissioning of any immovable property wherein transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some
other form) is involved in the execution of such contract;
41
8. The tax liability on a composite or a mixed supply shall be determined in the following
manner, namely:—
(a) a composite supply comprising two or more supplies, one of which is a principal supply, shall be treated as a
supply of such principal supply; and
(b) a mixed supply comprising two or more supplies shall be treated as a supply of that particular supply which
attracts the highest rate of tax.

68

Where Y = X*R/100
Thus from the known amount of Z, amounts of X and Y can be worked out.

d) Once the ‘on account / final contract certificate’ is prepared by Ministry/
Department and communicated to contractor, the contractor shall submit invoice
(bill) in a GST compliant format duly segregating the ‘Amount of work executed
excluding GST amount’ and ‘GST amount’ (i.e. “X” & “Y” as mentioned in para (iii)
above) along with Invoice No. (Bill No.) and all other details required under GST
act. In case any need arises to modify the Invoice (Bill) due to any reason,
contractor shall submit amended fresh invoice for processing the payment.

e) In case contractor is liable to be registered under GST Act, Ministry/ Department
shall pay to the Contractor ‘Gross amount of work executed’ (i.e. “Z” as mentioned
in para (iii) above) duly deducting all other leviable taxes like I/Tax, labour cess,
royalty etc. as applicable. Contractor shall be liable to pay ‘GST amount’ to
respective authority himself. Whereas, Ministry/ Department shall deposit all other
taxes deducted to concerned authority as is being done presently.

f) In case contractor is not liable to be registered under GST Act, contractor shall be
paid “Amount of work executed excluding GST amount” (i.e. “X” as mentioned in
para (iii) above) duly deducting all other leviable taxes like I/Tax, labour cess,
royalty etc. as applicable. Ministry/ Department shall deposit ‘GST amount’ as well
as all other taxes deducted to concerned authority.
ii) Pre-GST contracts need to be viewed in the light of the clauses of the contracts already
signed and provision for change in law.

Chapter 5: Evaluation of Bids and Award of Work
5.1

Evaluation of Bids

5.1.1 The evaluation of Bids is one of the most significant areas of purchase management
and the process must be transparent. All tenders are to be evaluated strictly on the basis of
the terms and conditions incorporated in the tender document and those stipulated by the
tenderers in their tenders. The Contracting Authority may include quality, price, technical merit,
aesthetic and functional characteristics, environmental characteristics, running costs, costeffectiveness, after-sales service and technical assistance, delivery date and delivery period
or period of completion etc. No criteria shall be used for evaluation of tenders that cannot be
verified or not stated in the contract, with the exception of provisions of laws in force. No
hearsay information or hitherto undeclared condition should be brought in while evaluating the
tenders. Similarly, no tender enquiry condition (especially the significant/ essential ones)
should be overlooked/ relaxed while evaluating the tenders. The aim should be to ensure that
no tenderer gets undue advantage at the cost of other tenderers and/ or at the cost of
Procuring Entity. Information relating to evaluation of tenders and the Tender Committee’s
(TC’s) deliberations should be confidential and not be shared with persons not officially
connected with the process. The process of tender evaluation proceeds is described in the
subsequent paras.

5.2

Schedule of Procurement Powers (SoPP)

5.2.1 There are delegations up to a low threshold value below which the evaluation of the
bids and decision for award of contract may be entrusted directly (instead on a
recommendation of a Tender Committee) to individual competent authority. He would himself
carry out all the steps in evaluation described below, instead of the TC and directly record
reasons and decision on the file itself. He may ask for a Technical Suitability report from User
Departments, if so needed. In procurements above such a threshold, evaluation is carried out
by Tender Committee consisting of three or more members with requisite experience and
competence. Members include a Financial Adviser or his representative and a representative
of the user as per SoPP. Procuring Entity should lay down a SoPP specifying such thresholds.
Experts may also be called in to assist the TC. TC should not be very large as it may slow
down the evaluation process. There is no need to constitute any other committee for technical
evaluation, preliminary evaluation etc. The representative of user Department will work as a
convener of the TC. No member of the tender committee should be reporting directly to any
other member of such committee in case estimated value of the procurement exceeds Rs. 25
lakh 42 . Though the GFR stipulates this provision only when the estimated value of the
procurement exceeds Rs. 25 lakh, it is desirable that the same provision should be followed
in the constitution of all purchase committees irrespective of the value of procurement. Every
Procuring Entity is expected to clearly lay down the powers, jurisdiction and composition of
different levels of Tender Committee and corresponding Accepting Authority for different
categories of procurement and different threshold values of procurements. Such an
arrangement ensures checks & balances in the Tender Evaluation Process. Competent
authority, in direct acceptance case; and member secretary of the Tender Committee will
receive the bids opened along with other documents from the tender opening officials and are
42

Rule 173 (xxii), GFR 2017

71

responsible for safe-custody of the documents and for processing involved at all steps in
finalising the Procurement. A model SoPP is attached in Appendix-4 for guidance.

5.3

Preparation of Comparative Statement and Briefing Note

5.3.1 Except in cases of LTE, the Procuring Entity should prepare a comparative statement
of quotations received in the order in which tenders were opened. In case of TechnoCommercial bid comparative statement will have information about deciding responsiveness
and eligibility of bids and evaluation of Technical suitability of offers. In case of Financial bid it
would have information about rates quoted (including taxes or otherwise), discount, if any, and
any other information having implications on ranking of bids etc The comparative statement
so prepared should be signed by the concerned officers. It may also be vetted by the
associated/ integrated Finance for veracity of information. It is also a good practice, to prepare
a briefing note by the member secretary of TC for guidance of other TC members, before first
TC meeting is held. In some organisations, the briefing note is also vetted by Finance. TC
cannot have tender accepting authority as a TC member.

5.4

Preliminary Examination

5.4.1

Confidentiality of Process
Information relating to the examination, clarification, evaluation and comparison of
bids, and recommendations for the award of a contract, shall not be disclosed to
bidders or any other person not officially concerned with such a process until the award
to the successful bidder has been announced.

i)

ii)

From the time of bid opening to the time of contract award, no bidder shall contact the
Procuring Entity on any matter related to the bid, except on request and prior written
permission.

iii)

Any effort by the bidder to influence the Procuring Entity in bid evaluation, bid
comparison or contract award decisions will vitiate the process and will result in the
rejection of the bidder's bid. Such conditions, incurring in (i) & (ii) above shall be
embedded in the Instructions to Bidders (ITB).

5.4.2 Unresponsive Tenders
Tenders that do not meet the basic requirements specified in the bid documents are to be
treated as unresponsive (both during Techno-commercial evaluation and Financial Evaluation
in case of Two Envelope bidding) and ignored. All tenders received will first be scrutinised by
the TC to see whether the tenders meet the basic requirements as incorporated in the Bid
document and to identify unresponsive tenders, if any. Unresponsive offers may not
subsequently be made responsive by correction or withdrawal of the non- conforming
stipulation. Some important points on the basis of which a tender may be declared as
unresponsive and be ignored during the initial scrutiny are:

i)

The tender is not in the prescribed format or is unsigned or not signed as per the
stipulations in the bid document;

ii)

The required EMD has not been provided or exemption from EMD is claimed without
acceptable proof of exemption;
The bidder is not eligible to participate in the bid as per laid down eligibility criteria
(example: the tender enquiry condition says that the bidder has to be a enlisted
contractor but the tenderer is not a enlisted contractor);

iii)

72

iv)

The bid departs from the essential requirements specified in the bidding document (for
example, the tenderer has not agreed to give the required performance security); or

v)

Against a schedule in the list of requirements in the tender enquiry, the tenderer has
not quoted for the entire requirement as specified in that schedule (example: in a
schedule, it has been stipulated that the tenderer will supply the equipment, install and
commission it and also train the Procuring Entity's operators for operating the
equipment. The tenderer has, however, quoted only for supply of the equipment).

5.4.3 Discrepancies between Original and Additional/ Scanned Copies of a Tender
Discrepancies can be observed in responsive tenders between the original copy and other
copies of the same tender set. In such a case, the text, and so on, of the original copy will
prevail. Such a discrepancy in an offer should be conveyed to the tenderer asking him to
respond by a target date and if the tenderer does not agree to Procuring Entity’s observation,
the tender is liable to be rejected. In e-Procurement there could be discrepancies between the
uploaded scanned copies and the Originals submitted by the bidder. However normally no
submission of original documents in physical format (other than Cost of Bid Documents, Bid
Security and statutory certificates if any) should be asked for in e-Procurement
5.4.4 Minor Infirmity/ Irregularity/ Non-conformity
During the preliminary examination, some minor infirmity and/ or irregularity and/ or nonconformity may also be found in some tenders. Such minor issues could be a missing pages/
attachment or illegibility in a submitted document; non-submission of requisite number of
copies of a document. There have been also cases where the bidder submitted the
amendment Bank Guarantee, but omitted to submit the main portion of Bid Document. The
court ruled that this is a minor irregularity. Such minor issues may be waived provided they do
not constitute any material deviation (please refer to Para 5.5.1 (iv) below) and financial impact
and, also, do not prejudice or affect the ranking order of the tenderers. Wherever necessary,
observations on such ‘minor’ issues (as mentioned above) may be conveyed to the tenderer
by registered letter/ speed post, and so on, asking him to respond by a specified date also
mentioning therein that, if the tenderer does not conform Procuring Entity’s view or respond
by that specified date, his tender will be liable to be rejected. Depending on the outcome, such
tenders are to be ignored or considered further.
5.4.5 Clarification of Bids/ Shortfall Documents
During evaluation and comparison of bids, the Procuring Entity may, at his discretion, ask the
bidder for clarifications on the bid. The request for clarification shall be given in writing by
registered/ speed post, asking the tenderer to respond by a specified date, and also
mentioning therein that, if the tenderer does not comply or respond by the date, his tender will
be liable to be rejected. Depending on the outcome, such tenders are to be ignored or
considered further. No change in prices or substance of the bid including specifications, shall
be sought, offered or permitted. No post-bid clarification at the initiative of the bidder shall be
entertained. The shortfall information/ documents should be sought only in case of historical
documents which pre-existed at the time of the tender opening and which have not undergone
change since then. These should be called only on basis of the recommendations of the TC.
(Example: if the Permanent Account Number, GSTN number has been asked to be submitted
and the tenderer has not provided them, these documents may be asked for with a target date
as above). So far as the submission of documents is concerned with regard to qualification
criteria, after submission of the tender, only related shortfall documents should be asked for

73

and considered. For example, if the bidder has submitted a contract without its completion/
performance certificate, the certificate can be asked for and considered. However, no new
contract should be asked for so as to qualify the bidder.

5.5

Evaluation of Responsive Bids

In case of single stage single envelope bidding, the evaluation of qualification of bidders,
technical, commercial and financial aspect is done simultaneously. In single stage multiple
envelopes, initially only the techno-commercial bids would be opened and evaluated for bids
which successfully meet the qualification criteria and techno-commercial aspects. Financial
bids of such successful bidders only would be opened for selecting the L1 bidder (the lowest
evaluated, substantially responsive, technically-suitable bid from eligible and qualified bidder)
among these and in case of manual tenders, financial bids of unsuccessful bidders would be
returned unopened to them. In two stage bids, the PQB/ EOI stage would have already been
evaluated as detailed in Chapter 3 and this second stage is for evaluation of responses to the
Second Stage multiple envelopes from the shortlisted qualified bidders. Evaluation of technocommercial and financial aspects are, however, discussed separately below.
5.5.1 Evaluation of Techno-commercial Bid
In evaluation of the techno-commercial bid, conformity of the eligibility/ qualification, technical
and commercial conditions to those in the bid document is ascertained. Additional factors, if
any, incorporated in the tender documents may also be considered in the manner indicated
therein. Evaluation has to be based only on the conditions included in the tender document
and any other condition should not form the basis of this evaluation. It is of utmost importance
that the authenticity, integrity and sanctity of unopened Financial Bids must be ensured, before
their opening. All the financial bids may preferably be put in a large envelope, which may be
dated, sealed and signed (including by some of the bidders present), to show that none of the
bids were accessed during the custody.

i) Evaluation of eligibility/ qualification Criteria: Procuring Entity will determine, to its
satisfaction, whether the tenderers are eligible, qualified and capable in all respects to
perform the contract satisfactorily. Tenders that do not meet the required eligibility/
qualification criteria prescribed will be treated as unresponsive and not considered
further. This determination will, inter-alia, take into account the tenderer’s financial,
technical and production capabilities for satisfying all of Procuring Entity’s
requirements as incorporated in the tender document. Such determination will be
based upon scrutiny and examination of all relevant data and details submitted by the
tenderer in its/ his tender as well as such other allied information as deemed
appropriate by Procuring Entity.
ii) Evaluation of Technical Suitability: The description, specifications, drawings and
other technical terms and conditions are examined by TC in general and technical
member(s) of the TC in particular. Nobody outside the TC should be allowed to
determine this evaluation. Even if an external expert’s advice and report is obtained, it
is still the responsibility of the technical member(s) in particular and the TC in general
to accept/ reject or modify the evaluation contained in such a report/ evaluation. The
tender document should clearly state whether alternative offers/ makes/ models would
be considered or not and, in the absence of an express statement to the effect, these
should not be allowed. An important document is the exceptions/ deviation form
submitted by the tenderer. It is important to judge whether an exception/ deviation is
minor or major. Minor exceptions/ deviations may be waived provided they do not

74

constitute any material deviation and do not have significant financial impact and, also,
would not prejudice or affect the ranking order of the price bid. Exceptions/ deviations
should not grant the tenderer any undue advantage vis-à-vis other tenders and
Procuring Entity.
iii) Evaluation of Commercial Conditions: The TC will also evaluate the commercial
conditions quoted by the tenderer to confirm that all terms and conditions specified in
the GCC/ SCC have been accepted without reservations by the tenderer. Only minor
deviations may be accepted/ allowed, provided these do not constitute material
deviations without financial impact and do not grant the tenderer any undue advantage
vis-à-vis other tenders and Procuring Entity.
iv) Considering Minor Deviations: Bids which are not materially deviated, may be
considered substantially responsive. Court has consistently taken a view that
procuring entity is entitled to consider and allow minor deviations, which do not amount
to material deviations. A material deviation, reservation, or omission which should not
be waived are those that:
i)

Affects, in any substantial way, the scope, quality or performance of the goods and
related services specified in the contract;

ii)

Limits, in any substantial way, inconsistent with the tendering documents, the
procuring entity's rights or the tenderer's obligations under the contract; or

iii) If rectified, would unfairly affect the competitive position of other tenderers quoting
substantially responsive tenders.

v) Declaration of Technically Compliant Bidders: If it is a multiple envelope tender,
then the TC prepares a recommendation of techno-commercial bid (Annexure 3) to
declare successful bidders. In such cases, after the approval of CA, the results of the
Techno-commercial bid evaluation are to be announced (including informing the failed
Bidders). Price bids are opened in the presence of technically suitable bidders, who
are willing to attend the bid opening, at a pre-publicised date, time and place or on the
portal in case of e-procurement. In single envelope/ cover tender, TC proceeds to
evaluate the price aspects without a reference to CA at this stage.
5.5.2 Right of Bidder to question rejection at Techno-commercial Stage
A tenderer shall have the right to be heard in case he feels that a proper procurement process
is not being followed and/ or his Techno-commercial bid has been rejected wrongly. The
tenderer is to be permitted to send his representation in writing. On receipt of representation
it may be decided whether to withhold opening of the financial bids and bidder may be
expeditiously replied. Certain decisions of the procuring entity in accordance with the provision
of internal guidelines shall not be subject to review as mentioned in para 5.7.3 below.
5.5.3

i)

ii)

Evaluation of Financial Bids and Ranking of Tenders
Unresponsive Tenders: Unresponsive tenders may again be identified after Financial
Bid opening, as in case of Technical Bid opening. If the price bid is ambiguous so that
it may very well lead to two equally valid total price amounts, then the bid should be
treated as unresponsive.
Non-conformities between Figures and Words: Sometimes, non-conformities/
errors are also observed in responsive tenders between the quoted prices in figures
and in words. This situation normally does not arise in case of e-Procurement. This

75

should be taken care by defining the treatment of bids in the tender documents in the
manner indicated below:
i)

If, in the price structure quoted for the requirements, there is discrepancy
between the unit price and total price (which is obtained by multiplying the unit
price by the quantity, or the total price is not worked out by bidder), the unit price
shall prevail and the total price corrected accordingly;

ii)

If there is an error in a total corresponding to the addition or subtraction of subtotals, the sub-totals shall prevail and the total shall be corrected; and

iii)

If there is a discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall
prevail.

iv)

Such a discrepancy in an offer should be conveyed to the tenderer asking him to
respond by a target date and if the tenderer does not agree to Procuring Entity’s
observation, the tender is liable to be rejected.

iii)

Correction of Bids: Tender document should indicate that the evaluated bid prices
will be adjusted after taking into account: (a) correction for errors; (b) adjustments for
any acceptable variations, deviations; and (c) adjustments to reflect any discounts or
other modifications offered. Unless announced beforehand explicitly in the tender
documents, the quoted price should not be loaded on the basis of deviations in the
commercial conditions. If it is decided to incorporate such clauses, these should be
unambiguous and clear – and thereafter there should be no relaxation during
evaluation. Variations, deviations, or alternative offers and other factors which are in
excess of the bidding documents or otherwise result in unsolicited benefits for the
contractor should not be taken into account in bid evaluation. All duties, taxes and other
levies payable by the bidder under the contract or for any other cause shall be included
in the rates, prices and total bid prices, and considered in evaluation of bids. Bids
should be checked for any arithmetical errors. These corrections shall be done in
accordance with the provisions of the bidding document. In cases other than eProcurement, the quoted rates in the bids shall be protected with lamination by the
committee, if not done by the bidders. In accordance with the corrections as approved
by the TC, the amount stated in the bid will be adjusted with the concurrence of the
bidder, and shall be binding on him. If the bidder does not accept the corrected amount,
the bid will be rejected and the bid security forfeited. The arithmetical corrections will
be done by the representatives of the Finance Division and the concerned (technical)
division in the committee.

iv)

Financial Evaluation: All responsive bids are evaluated by the TC with a view to select
the lowest (L1) bidder - the lowest evaluated, substantially responsive, bid which meets
the eligibility/ qualification criteria and techno-commercial aspects.

5.6

Deliberations by the Tender Committee

5.6.1

Timely Processing of Tenders
Delays in finalising procurement deprive the public of the intended benefits and results
in lost revenues and cost over-run. Currently, the Ministries/Departments are generally
awarding the contracts in 90 days from the date of tender opening for which the
Ministries/Departments are asking for a validity of offer by the contractors for 90 days.
In order to further shorten the period for award of contract, the Ministries/Departments

i)

76

should try to shorten the procurement decision period to 60 days from the date of
opening of the tenders in most of the cases. Only in exceptional cases, like two packet/
two stage bidding the period may be extended. However, in no case this time period
should exceed 75 days. The Ministries/ Departments may draw guidance from the
arrangements made by CPWD, where the validity of tenders has been fixed in the
following manner:Example 2: Maximum days for award of contract by CPWD

Complete Time schedule of finalising the Tender process from the date of issuing the
tender to date of issuing the contract, should be published in the Bid Documents. Every
official in the chain of the procurement operation is accountable for taking action in a
specified time so that the tender is finalised on time. Any deviation from the schedule
may be monitored and explained, by way of system of Management Reporting
(Appendix 4 and 5). As a check, the proposed schedule of tender process may be
printed on the inside cover of the Procurement File, where actual date of completion
of various stages may be recorded.
It has been also noted that delay in decision making after opening of certain tenders is
taking place because the Tender Committee (TC), wherever in place, are not meeting
frequently. In order to ensure that most of the tenders are decided as per the new
timelines as indicated in para above, (to be formally fixed individually by the concerned
Ministries/Departments), it has been decided that the Ministries/Departments may
notify at least one day of every week for the meeting of TC. Instructions may be issued
by concerned organisation that on such pre-fixed days, no member of the TC shall
normally take leave or proceed on tour etc.
After the decision has been taken by the competent authority (TC or individual
procuring officer) on the tender, such decision and the minutes of the TC (wherever
applicable), except the portion that may divulge third party technical/ commercial
confidential information, should be uploaded on the Central Public Procurement portal
(CPPP) within three working days for greater transparency. These details shall also be
uploaded on e-procurement portal or the website of the concerned Ministry/
Department/ CPSU within three working days.

5.6.2 Extension of Tender Validity Period
The entire process of scrutiny and evaluation of tenders, preparation of ranking statement and
notification of award must be done expeditiously and within the original tender validity period.
The validity period should not be unreasonably long as keeping the tender unconditionally

77

valid for acceptance for a longer period entails the risk of getting higher prices from the
tenderers.
If, however, due to some exceptional and unforeseen reasons, the purchase organisation is
unable to decide on the placement of the contract within the original validity period, it may
preferably request, before expiry of the original validity period, all the responsive tenderers to
extend their tenders up to a specified period. While asking for such extension, the tenderers
are also to be asked to extend their offers as it is, without any changes therein. They may also
be told to extend the validity of the EMD for the corresponding additional period (which is to
be specified in the request). A tenderer may not agree to such a request and this will not lead
to forfeiture of its EMD. But the tenderers, who agree to extend the validity, are to do so without
changing any terms, conditions, and so on, of their original tenders.
Reasons for seeking extension of bid validity should be recorded by the procuring officers.
5.6.3 Reasonableness of Prices
In every recommendation of the TC for award of contract, it must be declared that the rates
recommended are reasonable. The comparison maybe made with the similar contracts
awarded elsewhere. The Last Purchase Price (LPP) maybe updated taking into consideration
inflation during the interim period and geographical conditions etc.
5.6.4 Consideration of Abnormally Low Bids
An Abnormally Low Bid is one in which the Bid price, in combination with other elements of
the Bid, appears so low that it raises material concerns as to the capability of the Bidder to
perform the contract at the offered price. Procuring Entity may in such cases seek written
clarifications from the Bidder, including detailed price analyses of its Bid price in relation to
scope, schedule, resource mobilization, allocation of risks and responsibilities, and any other
requirements of the bids document. If, after evaluating the price analyses, procuring entity
determines that the Bidder has substantially failed to demonstrate its capability to deliver the
contract at the offered price, the Procuring Entity may reject the Bid/ Proposal. However it
would not be advisable to fix a normative percentage below the estimated cost, which would
automatically be considered as an abnormally low bid.
As a safeguard, it should be closely monitored that final payments in such cases do not
abnormally increases due to extra items. Further, there is no abnormal increase in quantities
of the item for which contractors have initially quoted very high rates.
5.6.5 Cartel Formation/ Pool Rates
It is possible that sometimes a group of bidders quote the same rate against a tender. Such
pool/ cartel formation is against the basic principle of competitive bidding and defeats the very
purpose of an open and competitive tendering system. Such and similar tactics to avoid/
control true competition in a tender leading to "appreciable adverse effect on competition"
have been declared as an offence under the Competition Act, 2002, as amended by the
Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007. Such practices should be severely discouraged with
strong measures. In case of evidence of cartel formation, detailed cost analysis may be done
by associating experts if necessary. Besides, suitable administrative actions can be resorted
to, such as rejecting the offers, reporting the matter to trade associations, the Competition
Commission etc., and requesting them, inter-alia, to take suitable strong actions against such
firms. New firms may also be encouraged to get themselves enlisted for the subject goods to
break the monopolistic attitude of the firms forming a cartel. Changes in the mode of
procurement (post qualification instead of pre-qualification) and packaging/ slicing of the work

78

may also be tried. A warning clause may also be included in the bid documents to discourage
the bidders from indulging in such practices.
5.6.6

i)

Negotiations
Normally, there should be no negotiation. Negotiations should be a rare exception
rather than the rule and may be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances. If it is
decided to hold negotiations for reduction of prices, they should be held only with the
lowest acceptable bidder (L1), who is techno-commercially responsive for the supply
of a bulk quantity and on whom the contract would have been placed but for the
decision to negotiate. In no case, including where a cartel/ pool rates are suspected,
should negotiations be extended to those who had either not tendered originally or
whose tender was rejected because of unresponsiveness of bid, unsatisfactory
credentials, inadequacy of capacity or unworkable rates. The circumstances where
negotiations may be considered could be:
a)

Where the procurement is done on nomination basis;

b)

Procurement is from single or limited sources;

c) Procurements where there is suspicion of cartel formation which should be
recorded; and
d) Where the requirements are urgent and the delay in re-tendering for the entire
requirement due to the unreasonableness of the quoted rates would jeopardise
essential operations, maintenance and safety, negotiations with L1 bidder(s) may
be done for bare minimum quantum of requirements. The balance bulk requirement
should, however, be procured through a re-tender, following the normal tendering
process.

ii)

The decision whether to invite fresh tenders or to negotiate and with whom, should be
made by the tender accepting authority based on the recommendations of the TC.
Convincing reasons must be recorded by the authority recommending negotiations.
The CA should exercise due diligence while accepting a tender or ordering negotiations
or calling for a re-tender and a definite timeframe should be indicated.

iii)

Normally all counter offers are considered negotiations by other means and the
principles of negotiations should apply to such counter offers. For example, a counter
offer to L1, in order to arrive at an acceptable rate, shall amount to a negotiation.
However, any counter offer to L2, L3, and so on (at the rates accepted by L1) in case
of splitting of quantities shall not be deemed to be a negotiation.

iv)

After the CA or TC has decided to call a specific bidder for negotiation, the following
procedure should be adopted:
a) Negotiations must be carried out by the CA or TC only;
b) It must be understood that, if the period of validity of the original offer expires before
the close of negotiations, the original offer will not be available for acceptance. The
period of validity of the original offer must, therefore, be extended, wherever
necessary, before negotiations;
c) The tenderer to be called in for negotiations should be addressed as per the format
of letter laid down in Annexure 4, so that the rates originally quoted by him shall
remain open for acceptance in the event of failure of the contemplated negotiation;

79

d) A negotiations meeting should be started only after obtaining a signed declaration
from the negotiating contractor as per Annexure 4; and
e) Revised bids should be obtained in writing from the selected tenderers at the end
of the negotiations in the format of letter laid down in Annexure 5. The revised bids
so obtained should be read out to the tenderers or their representatives present,
immediately after completing the negotiations. If necessary, the negotiating party
may be given some time to submit its revised offer. In case, however, the selected
bidder prefers to send a revised bid instead of being present at the negotiation, the
offer should be taken into account. In case a bidder does not submit the revised
bid, its original bid shall be considered.
5.6.7 Consideration of Lack of Competition
Sometimes, against advertised/ limited tender cases, the procuring entity may not receive a
sufficient number of bids and/ or after analysing the bids, ends up with only one responsive
bid – a situation referred to as ‘Single Offer’. As per Rule 21 of DFPR (explanation sub-para),
such situation of ‘Single Offer’ is to be treated as Single Tender. The contract may be placed
on the ‘Single Offer’ bidder provided the quoted price is reasonable. However restricted
powers of Single tender mode of procurement would apply. Before retendering, the procuring
entity is first to check whether, while floating/ issuing the enquiry, all necessary requirements
and formalities such as standard conditions, industry friendly specification, wide publicity,
sufficient time for bidding, and so on, were fulfilled. If not, a fresh enquiry is to be issued after
rectifying the deficiencies. It has become a practice among some procuring entities to routinely
assume that open tenders which result in single bids are not acceptable and to go for retender
as a safe course of action. This is not correct. Re-bidding has costs: firstly the actual costs of
retendering; secondly the delay in execution of the work with consequent delay in the
attainment of the purpose for which the procurement is being done; and thirdly the possibility
that the re-bid may result in a higher bid. Lack of competition shall not be determined solely
on the basis of the number of bidders. Even when only one bid is submitted, the process may
be considered valid provided following conditions are satisfied:
i)

The procurement was satisfactorily advertised and sufficient time was given for
submission of bids;

ii)

The qualification criteria were not unduly restrictive; and

iii)

Prices are reasonable in comparison to market values

However restricted powers of Single tender mode of procurement would apply. In case of price
not being reasonable, negotiations (being L1) or retender may be considered as justifiable.
Unsolicited offers against LTEs should be ignored, however Ministries/ Departments should
evolve a system by which interested firms can enlist and bid in next round of tendering.
5.6.8

Rejection of All Bids/ Re-tender

i)

The Procuring Entity may cancel the process of procurement or rejecting all bids at
any time before intimating acceptance of successful bid under circumstances
mentioned below. In case where responsive bids are available, the aim should be to
finalise the tender by taking mitigating measures even in the conditions described
below. If it is decided to rebid the tender, the justification should balance the perceived
risks in finalisation of tender (marginally higher rates) against the certainty of resultant
delays, cost escalations, loss of transparency in re-invited tender. After such decision,

80

all participating bidders would be informed and bids if not opened would not be opened
and in case of manual tenders be returned unopened:
a. If the quantity and quality of requirements have changed substantially or there
is an un-rectifiable infirmity in the bidding process;
b. when none of the tenders is substantially responsive to the requirements of the
Procurement Documents;
c. none of the technical Proposals meets the minimum technical qualifying score;
d. If effective competition is lacking. However, lack of competition shall not be
determined solely on the basis of the number of Bidders. (Please refer to para
above also regarding receipt of a single offer).
e. the Bids’/ Proposals’ prices arfe substantially higher than the updated cost
estimate or available budget;
f. In case, the bidder, whose bid has been found to be the lowest evaluated bid
withdraws or whose bid has been accepted, fails to sign the procurement
contract as may be required or fails to provide the security as may be required
for the performance of the contract or otherwise withdraws from the
procurement process, the Procuring Entity shall re-tender the case.

ii)

Approval for re-tendering should be accorded by the CA after recording the reasons/
proper justification in writing. The Procuring Entity should review the qualification
criteria, and technical and commercial terms of the tender before re-tendering and also
consider wider publicity to attract an adequate number of responses. The decision of
the procuring entity to cancel the procurement and reasons for such a decision shall
be immediately communicated to all bidders that participated in the procurement
process. Before retendering, the procuring entity is first to analyse the reasons leading
to retender and check whether, while floating/ issuing the enquiry, all necessary
requirements and formalities such as standard conditions, industry friendly
qualification criteria, and technical and commercial terms, wide publicity, sufficient time
for bidding, and so on, were fulfilled. If not, a fresh enquiry is to be issued after rectifying
the deficiencies.

5.6.9

Handling Dissent among Tender Committee

Tender Committee duties are to be discharged personally by the nominated officers. They
may take help of their subordinate officers by way of reports/ evaluations, but they would still
be answerable for such decisions. TC members cannot co-opt or nominate others to attend
deliberations on their behalf. TC deliberations are best held across the table and not through
circulation of notes.
All members of the TC should resolve their differences through personal discussions instead
of making to and fro references in writing. In cases where it is not possible to come to a
consensus and differences persist amongst TC members, the reasons for dissent of a member
should be recorded in a balanced manner along with the majority’s views on the dissent note.
The final recommendations should be that of the majority view. However, such situations
should be rare. CA can overrule such dissent notes after recording reasons for doing so
clearly. His decision would be final.
In cases where the CA does not agree with the majority or unanimous recommendations of
the TC, he should record his views and, if possible, firstly send it back to TC to reconsider
along the lines of the tender accepting authority’s views. However, if the TC, after considering

81

the views of the CA, sticks to its own earlier recommendations, the tender accepting authority
can finally decide as deemed fit, duly recording detailed reasons. He will be responsible for
such decisions. However, such situations should be rare.
5.6.10 Independence, Impartiality, Confidentiality and ‘No Conflict of Interest’ at all
Stages of Evaluation of Bids
All technical, commercial and finance officials who have contributed to the techno-commercial
or financial evaluation of bids, even though they may not be part of the TC should deal with
the procurement in an independent, impartial manner and should have no conflict of interest
in the form of any liaison or relationship with any of the bidder involved in the procurement.
They should also maintain confidentiality of the information processed during the evaluation
process and not allow it to reach any unauthorised person. All TC members should sign a
declaration at the end of their reports/ noting stating that, “I declare that I have no conflict of
interest with any of the bidder in this tender”. TC members may make such a declaration at
the end of their reports. GFR 2017 [Rule 173 (xxii)] mandates that In case a Tender Committee
is constituted to purchase or recommend the procurement, no member of the purchase
Committee should be reporting directly to any other member of such Committee, to ensure
independent expression of views.
5.6.11 Tender Committee Recommendations/ Report
The TC has to make formal recommendations (Annexure 3) for the award of the contract to
the bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive and the lowest
evaluated bid, provided further that the bidder is determined to be qualified to perform the
contract satisfactorily and his credentials have been verified. It is a good practice that TC
should spell out salient terms and conditions of the offer(s) recommended for acceptance. It
should also be ensured by the TC that any deviation/ variation quoted by the contractor in his
bid are not left un-deliberated and ruled upon in the TC; otherwise there may be delay in
acceptance of the contract by the contractor. These recommendations are submitted for
approval to the tender accepting authority. Since a nominee of Financial Adviser of the
Department is usually a member of the Tender Committee, there is no need for the CA to
consult the FA of the Department before accepting the TC recommendations. In any purchase
decision, the responsibility of the CA is not discharged merely by selecting the cheapest offer
or accepting TC recommendations but ensuring whether:

i) Offers have been invited in accordance with this manual and after following fair and
reasonable procedures in prevailing circumstances;

ii) He is satisfied that the selected offer will adequately meet the requirement for which it is
being procured;

iii) The price of the offer is reasonable and consistent with the quality required; and
iv) The accepted offer is the most appropriate taking all relevant factors into account in
keeping with the standards of financial propriety.
After the acceptance of these recommendations by the tender accepting authority, the Letter
(Notification) of Award (LOA) can be issued.

5.7

Award of Work

5.7.1

LOA to Successful Bidder

82

Prior to the expiry of the period of bid validity, the successful bidder will be notified (briefly
indicating therein relevant details such as quantity, specification of the goods ordered, prices,
and so on) in writing by a registered letter or any other acknowledgeable and foolproof method
that his bid has been accepted. Legally communication of acceptance of offer is considered
complete as soon as it is submitted to Postal authorities (please refer to Para 2.8 of Appendix
2). A template for the Letter of Acceptance (or Notice of Award, or Acceptance of Tender) is
given in Annexure 6. In the same communication, the successful tenderer is to be instructed
to furnish the required performance security within a specified period [generally 14 (fourteen)
days].
In respect of contracts upto Rupees ten lakh, where tender documents include the General
Conditions of Contract (GCC), Special Conditions of Contract (SCC) and scope of work, the
letter of acceptance will result in a binding contract.
In respect of contracts with estimated value more than Rupees ten lakh, a contract document
should be executed, with all necessary clauses to make it a self contained contract. If,
however, these are preceded by Invitation to Tender, accompanied by GCC and SCC, with
full details of scope and specifications a simple one page contract can be entered into by
attaching copies of the GCC and SCC, and details of scope and specifications, offer of the
tenderer and letter of acceptance.
Contract document should be invariably executed in cases of turnkey works or agreements
for maintenance of equipment, provision of services etc.
5.7.2

Publication of Tender Results and Return of EMD of Unsuccessful Bidders

GFR 2017 (Rule 159) makes it mandatory to publish details of Bid award on the CPPP and
also in the notice board/ bulletin/ website of the concerned ministry or department/ eProcurement Portal. In case publication of such information is sensitive from commercial or
security aspects, dispensation may be sought from publishing of such results by obtaining
sanction from the Secretary of the Department with the concurrence of the concerned
Financial Advisor. In the case of Autonomous Bodies and Statutory Bodies’ approval of the
Head of the Body with the concurrence of the Head of the Finance should be obtained in each
such case. Statistical information on the number of cases in which exemption was granted
and the value of the concerned contract should be intimated on a quarterly basis to the Ministry
of Finance, Department of Expenditure. Upon the successful bidder furnishing the signed
agreement and performance security, each unsuccessful bidder will be promptly notified and
their bid security be returned without interest within 30 (thirty) days of notice of award of
contract. The successful contractor’s bid security shall be adjusted against the SD or returned
as per the terms of the tender documents.
In cases, where PSUs compete with private firms in public tenders, publication of details of
contracts awarded by the PSU concerned to various sub-vendors, suppliers, technology
providers and other associates before firming up their offer, may hurt the interest of the PSU
as the competitors may get to know the details of sub-venders, suppliers, technology providers
and other associates as well as the price at which the contracts are placed. Therefore, in such
cases, publication of details of contracts awarded may be dispensed with.
5.7.3

Bidder’s right to question rejection

A tenderer shall have the right to be heard in case he feels that a proper procurement process
is not being followed and/ or his tender has been rejected wrongly. The tenderer is to be

83

permitted to send his representation in writing. Bidding documents should explicitly mention
the name, designation and contact details of officers nominated to receive representations in
this regard. The procuring entity should ensure a decision within 15 (fifteen) days of the receipt
of the representation. Only a directly affected bidder can represent in this regard:

i) Only a bidder who has participated in the concerned procurement process i.e. prequalification, bidder enlistment or bidding, as the case may be, can make such
representation

ii) In case pre-qualification bid has been evaluated before the bidding of technical/ financial
bids, an application for review in relation to the technical/ financial bid may be filed only by
a bidder has qualified in pre-qualification bid;

iii) In case technical bid has been evaluated before the opening of the financial bid, an
application for review in relation to the financial bid may be filed only by a bidder whose
technical bid is found to be acceptable
Following decisions of the procuring entity in accordance with the provision of internal
guidelines shall not be subject to review:
a) Determination of the need for procurement;
b) Selection of the mode of procurement or bidding system;
c) Choice of selection procedure;
d) Provisions limiting participation of bidders in the procurement process;
e) The decision to enter into negotiations with the L1 bidder;
f)

Cancellation of the procurement process except where it is intended to subsequently retender the same requirements;

g) Issues related to ambiguity in contract terms may not be taken up after a contract has been
signed, all such issues should be highlighted before consummation of the contract by the
vendor/ contractor; and
h) Complaints against specifications except under the premise that they are either vague or
too specific so as to limit competition may be permissible.
5.7.4

Performance Security

The contractor receiving the LOA is required to furnish the required performance security, if it
is part of tender conditions, in the prescribed form by the specified date; failing this necessary
action including forfeiture of EMD will be taken against the contractor.
5.7.5 Acknowledgement of Contract by Successful Bidder and Execution
After the successful bidder is notified that his bid has been accepted, he will be sent an
agreement for signature and return, incorporating all agreements between the parties. The
contractor should acknowledge and unconditionally accept, sign, date and return the
agreement within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of issue of the contract in case of OTE and
21 (twenty-one) days in case of GTE. Such acknowledgements may not be required in low
value contracts, below Rs one lakh or when the bidders offer has been accepted in entirety,
without any modifications. If both parties (Procuring Entity and the contractor) simultaneously
sign the contract across the table, further acknowledgement from the contractor is not
required. It should also be made known to the successful tenderer that in case he does not

84

furnish the required performance security or does not accept the contract within the stipulated
target dates, such non-compliance will constitute sufficient ground for forfeiture of its EMD and
processing the case for further action against it (the successful tenderer).
All contracts shall be signed and entered into after receipt and verification of the requisite
performance security, by an authority empowered to do so by or under the orders of the
President of India in terms of Article 299 (1) of the Constitution of India. The words “for and on
behalf of the President of India” should follow the designation appended below the signature
of the officer authorised on this behalf. The various classes of contracts and assurances of
property, which may be executed by different authorities, are specified in the DFPR. No
contract on behalf of an organisation of Procuring Entity should be entered into by any
authority which has not been empowered to do so under the orders of the state government.
5.7.6

Framing of Contract

The following general principles should be observed while entering into contracts:

i)

Any agreement shall be issued strictly as per approved TC recommendations, be
vetted by the Associated/ integrated Finance and approved by CA. The terms of
contract must be complete, precise, definite and without any ambiguities. The terms
should not involve an uncertain or indefinite liability, except in the case of a cost plus
contract or where there is price variation in the contract. In other words, no contract
involving an uncertain or indefinite liability or any condition of an unusual character
should be entered into without the previous consent of the Associated/ integrated
Finance.

ii)

All contracts shall contain a provision for
a) Recovery of liquidated damages (LD) for delay in performance of the contract on
the part of the contractor;
b) A warranty clause/ defect liability clause should be incorporated in contracts for
plant and machinery and works, above a threshold value, requiring the contractor
to, without charge, replace, repair or rectify defective goods/ works/ services;
c) All contracts for supply of goods should reserve the right of the government to
reject goods which do not conform to the specifications;
d) Payment of all applicable taxes by the contractor; and
e) When a contract is likely to endure for a period of more than two years, it should,
wherever feasible, include a provision for an unconditional power of revocation or
cancellation by the government at any time on the expiry of six months’ notice to
that effect.
f)

iii)

Standard forms of contracts should be invariably adopted, except in following cases:
a)

43

How the appointed day or day of starting of the work shall be determined.

43

A Ministry or Department may, at its discretion, make purchases of value up
to Rupees two lakh and fifty thousand by issuing purchase orders containing
basic terms and conditions

Rule 255 (iv) (a), GFR 2017

85

5.7.7

b)

In cases where standard forms of contracts are not used or where modifications
in standard forms are considered necessary in respect of individual contracts,
legal and financial advice should be taken in drafting the clauses in the contract
and approval of CAs is to be obtained; and

c)

Copies of all contracts and agreements for purchases of the value of Rs. 25
(twenty-five) lakh and above, and of all rate and running contracts entered into
by civil departments of the government should be sent to the Accountant
General.

Procurement Records

The Procurement file should start with the indent and related documents. All subsequent
documents relating to procurement planning; Copy of Bid Document and documents relating
to its and formulation, publishing and issue/ uploading; Bid Opening; Bids received;
correspondence and documents (including Technical Evaluation and TC report)relating to prequalification, evaluation, Award of Contract; and finally the contract copy, should be kept on
the file. In case of bulky bids received, all bids received may be kept in a separate volume,
with a copy of accepted bids later being put on the main volume. To maintain integrity of the
records relating to procurement, these files should be kept secure and for contract
management a new volume of file may be opened to obviate frequent exposure of sensitive
procurement file. In contract management volume, copies of successful bid, Tender
Committee Report & Contract may also be kept for ready reference, besides correspondence
and documents relating to Contract Management and its closure. These documents can be
very valuable at the time of arbitration, dispute, court proceedings, claims etc. and hence
needs to be safeguarded.

Chapter 6: Execution and Monitoring of Works and Quality
Assurance
6.1 Execution and Monitoring of Work
No work shall be commenced unless the conditions precedent as laid down in Para 1.10 (xi)
have been fulfilled.
6.1.1 A competent Project Management Team shall be set up including training on Project
Management to the team, if required.
6.1.2 Monitoring System: A system of project monitoring for each work shall be prepared
before start of the work and same shall be available at site of work. 'Deadlines' or 'contractual
milestones' should be set up and tabulated to facilitate monitoring of the progress of work. The
work shall be monitored quarterly/ monthly basis by the Works Committee and a status report
should be submitted to the Secretary in charge of the concerned Ministry/ Department.
All complex assignments require the use of proper project management tools that enable the
contract management team (procuring entity, engineer, project manager, etc.) to
collaboratively monitor the actual; physical and financial progress of the contract against the
planned physical and financial schedule. The contract may also specify that the contractor
engage certified project management professionals to train and monitor project progress (e.g.:
PMI certified engineers). There are many project management tools and software
programmes that are extremely useful for the contract management team. Some of the
common software programmes are (no endorsements are intended, there are many more
such software available): Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (MS PPM) and Oracle
Primavera P6 Professional Project Management (P6 PPM).
6.1.3 Fulfilling the Conditions Precedent to Land Acquisition and Other Clearances
and Permits: The process of land acquisition shall be started by the Procuring Entity, well
ahead and completed entirely, or at least substantially, by the time the contract is awarded.
The Procuring Entity shall also seek requisite Statutory Approvals/ Permission/ Clearances/
Certificates from the concerned Local Bodies & Statutory Authorities like District Authorities,
Municipal Corporation, Panchayati Raj Institutions, Town Planning Board, Electricity Board/
Fire Department, State/ Central Pollution Control Boards, Stale/ Central Environmental
Authorities, Forrest and Wild-life authorities etc(for e.g. removal of trees, re-locating utilities;
conversion of railway level crossings, laying of railway sidings needed by the project;
rehabilitation and resettlement of persons affected by the project; traffic control; mining of earth
and stone; interfering protected monuments; blasting permission, environmental/ forest/ wildlife clearances; and shifting of religious shrines etc), so that the progress of work is not
impeded and incidence of delay claims by the contractor avoided. The Procuring Entity has to
be aware that any delay in fulfilling the conditions precedent stipulated in the contract will
attract delay claims form the contractor, besides causing time and cost overruns. Hence, all
or most conditions precedent shall be fulfilled before award of the LoA. The contractor shall
give all notices and obtain all other necessary permits and approvals as may be required for
the construction of the contract works and shall pay for all such permits and approvals.
6.1.4 Commencement of Work: After signing the contract and issue of LoA, the engineer
should instruct the contractor to 'commence the works', only after all the above mentioned
land availability, clearances and permits have been obtained. The contractor, within the

89

stipulated time, should submit to the engineer for his consent: (i) the work programme in such
form and detail as the engineer reasonably prescribes; (ii) methods statement which the
contractor proposes to adopt for execution of the works; and (iii) the quality assurance plan.
The Procuring Entity should on being satisfied with Contractor’s submission provide to the
contractor total or partial possession of the site.
6.1.5 Approval of Quarries and Borrow Areas and Materials: The contractor will obtain
approval of the engineer for each quarry and borrow area to be used in the project, prior to
commencement of quarrying and/ or borrow area excavation activities. All materials (whether
natural, processed, manufactured, or designed) proposed by the contractor to be used on the
works shall be first approved by the engineer to comply with the requirements of specifications.
6.1.6 Sub-contracting: The works contract may provide for the contractor to get specified
works executed from sub-contractors included in the pre-qualification application or later
agreed to by the Procuring Entity, with a caveat that the responsibility for all sub-contract work
rests with the prime contractor. Sub-contracting will generally be for specialized items of work,
such as reinforced earth retaining walls, pre-stressing works, and so on. Procurement of
material, hire of equipment or engagement of labour will not mean sub-contracting. The total
value of sub-contracting work will not exceed the per cent of the contract price as specified in
the contract (say 25 (twenty-five) percent). Sub-contracting by the contractor without the
approval of the Procuring Entity shall be a breach of contract, unless explicitly permitted in the
contract.
6.1.7 Safety at Work Site: The Contractor must ensure safety of workmen as well as safety
for the general public during construction in and around work-site. He must follow the laws,
codes and standards laid down in this regard. The work-men must be trained and provided
protective gear, life-saving equipment and appropriate tools for their jobs. Special precautions
must be used if hazardous chemicals are used or stored at workplace (lead, silica, asbestos
and wood/stone that will be cut and generate dust, construction materials containing zinc,
cadmium, beryllium and mercury).Besides protection from noise and environmental pollution,
public must also be safeguarded from falling through dug-up area, electrocution, flooding,
falling objects, bridge-span dropping/ failures, crane falling/ overturning and damage to
building from vibrations/ cave-ins from construction activities. Engineer must ensure that
contractor does not adopt any short-cut in this regard. Most large contracts have a well defined
Safety Health & Environment (SHE) guidelines embedded in the agreement. Appointment of
site safety engineer by the contractor is a mandatory requirement in such cases. The engineer
shall engage safety experts to carry out frequent SHE audits and mandate correct measures.
6.1.8 Progress Reporting & Review: There should be a stipulation in the contract for large
value works (magnitude to be specified), for the contractor to submit project specific monthly
progress report of the work in a computerized form (Management Information System
Reports– MIS reports). The progress report shall contain the following apart from whatever
else may be required to be specified:

i)

Project information, giving the broad features of the contract.

ii)

Introduction, giving a brief scope of the work under the contract and the broad
structural or other details.

iii)

Construction schedule of the various components of the work, through a bar chart for
the next three quarters for as may be specified, showing the milestones, targeted tasks
and up to date progress.

90

iv)

Progress chart of the various components of the work that are planned and achieved,
for the month as well as cumulative up to the month, with reasons for deviations, if any,
in a tabular format.

v)

Plant and machinery statement, indicating those deployed in the work, and their
working status.

vi)

Man-power statement, indicating individually the names of all the staff deployed in the
work along with their designations.

vii)

Financial statement, indicating the broad details of all the running account payments
received up to date, such as gross value of work done, advances taken, recoveries
effected, amounts withheld, net payments, details of cheque payments received, etc.

viii)

A statement showing the extra and substituted items submitted by the contractor, and
the payments received against them, broad details of the bank Guarantees, indicating
clearly their validity periods, broad details of the insurance policies taken by the
contractor, if any, the advances received and adjusted from the department, etc.

ix)

Progress photographs, in colour, of the various items/ components of the work done
up to date, to indicate visually the actual progress of the work.

x)

Quality assurance and quality control tests conducted during the month, with the
results thereof.

xi)

Any hold-up shall be specified.

xii)

Dispute, if any, shall also be highlighted.

xiii)

Monthly or fortnightly progress review by engineer and Procuring Entity with contractor
may be necessary to ensure that contractor deploys sufficient resources to meet the
deadlines.

6.2

Quality Assurance

6.2.1 In order to control the quality of work, a Quality Assurance Cell shall be formed in every
work centre comprising of multi- disciplinary professionals/ engineers to cover all types of
works, such as civil, mechanical, electrical etc.
6.2.2 In case of non-availability of qualified professionals/ engineers in house for the purpose
of quality assurance cell, then the approval of competent authority shall have to be taken for
deploying professionals from outside agencies. The provision for third party quality check may
also be considered for a work beyond a specified amount.

6.3

Design Approvals

In case of EPC contracts approval of the designs should be taken from the appropriate
authority, as defined in the tender document, to ensure that the performance level are met by
the design.

6.4

Time Monitoring

6.4.1

Time At Large

When the Procuring Entity does not explicitly express and reserve its rights and remedies
under the contract for delays in execution, it legally forfeits his right to such remedies. Under
such circumstances Time is said to become at large and the contractor gets freed from his
obligation to complete within the specified time. To avoid such a situation, before the expiry of

91

originally stipulated date of completion, the Procuring Entity should extend the currency of the
agreement and set a new time limit for completion and make the extended time as essence of
the contract, stipulating that this is being done without prejudice to his right to recover
damages and other remedies as per the contract.
6.4.2

Force Majeure (FM) Clause

Conditions beyond control of either parties like war, hostility, acts of public enemy, civil
commotion, sabotage, serious loss or damage by fire, explosions, epidemics, strikes, lockouts
or acts of God come under the legal concept of Force Majeure (FM). Delays in performance
of contractual obligations under influence of FM conditions are condonable by the other party
without any right to termination or damages, provided, notice of the happening of any such
event is given by the affected party to the other within 30 (thirty) days from the date of
occurrence. Works under the contract shall be resumed as soon as practicable after such
event has come to an end or ceased to exist. However if such event continue for a period
exceeding 120 days, either party may at its option terminate the contract by giving notice to
the other party.
6.4.3

Delays in Execution

i)

A work may be completed ahead of schedule or delayed due to unforeseen fortuitous
circumstances, extra effort or developments beyond the control of the procuring entity
or the tenderer and it is sometimes difficult to apportion credit or responsibility. The
contractor may experience delay or disruption due to his own actions or inaction, those
of his sub-contractor or other contractors, those of the procuring entity or the engineer,
or other causes. Such delays expose the non-performing party to various sanctions
under the contract. These sanctions include extension of time, damages or default
termination of the contract. While examining the request of the contractor for extension
of time, the engineer shall consider all circumstances and categorise the delays as
follows:
a)

Excusable delays - Force Majeure (FM), that is, acts of God, abnormal weather,
floods, and so on, applies;

b)

Compensable delays – or Compensation Events, which put full burden of
responsibility on the Procuring Entity as covered in the GCC; and

c)

Inexcusable delay (contractor’s own faults), which puts the full burden of
responsibility on the contractor.

d)

Concurrent delays - when two or more events responsible for delay overlap
each other. The delays may be attributable to the Procuring Entity or the
contractor or none, and fall in above categories. The eligibility for extension of
time (EOT) should be determined by plotting each contributing concurrent delay
on the critical path. The Procuring Entity should see that the concurrent delays
do not result in unnecessary extra extension of time.

ii)

Once the delay is categorised, it should then be determined not only whether the
contractor is eligible for time extension and/ or monetary relief but also whether
sanctions, such as Liquidated Damage (LD) or default termination, can be imposed on
the contractor.

6.4.4

Liquidated Damages and Incentives/ Bonus

92

Normally, tenders shall be invited with reference to a pre-determined period of completion of
works. Provision of incentives for completion of work before schedule should be sparingly
made after careful assessment of tangible benefits there from and disclosed in the tender
documents in clear monetary terms.
Incentives/ Bonus (e.g. one percent of the contract value per month subject to a maximum of
five percent of contract value) for early completion and penalties for delay should, therefore,
be built into the contract very judiciously. To avail of the incentive clause, it shall be mandatory
on the part of the contractor to report the actual date of completion to the concerned Engineer
(Engineer herein refers to PWO/ PSU/ Organisation to which work has been entrusted under
Rule 133 of GFR 2017). The Engineer shall report the actual date of completion of the works
as soon as possible through fax or email so that the report is received within seven days of
such completion by the concerned CA.
In case of delay in completion of the contract, liquidated damages (for repair works costing up
to Rs. Ten lakh - one percent of the contract value per week and for all other works half percent
of the contract value per week of delay subject to a maximum of ten percent of contract value)
should be levied. The penalties proposed for identified lapses of omission or commission must
be disclosed in the tender documents in clear monetary terms.
6.4.5

Extension of Time (EOT)

i)

Extension of Time (EOT) must not be left to the end; it should be dealt with promptly
during the progress of the contract and for ongoing critical delay interim EOT may be
awarded. The engineer shall, after due consultation with the procuring entity and the
contractor, determine the length of such extension and notify the contractor accordingly,
with a copy to the procuring entity. After the final stage of completion is reached (final
taking-over certificate issued), EOT and LD may be reviewed, if required.

ii)

If a compensation event occurs during the execution of the contract, the same shall be
dealt with in terms of the GCC. The Engineer will assess whether and by how much the
intended completion date shall be extended.

iii)

Organsations may put in place a graded authority structure whereby extension of time
for completion of contract, beyond a specified threshold value of contract, may be
granted by the next higher authority.

6.5

Financial Monitoring

Besides administering the contract with regard to its quality and completion, the engineer will
regularly assess the financial position and exercise financial control. He will update, on a
quarterly basis, cash flow projections, cost estimates and yearly/ quarterly milestones, and
submit them to the Procuring Entity. Variations should take place with a view to achieving
economical completion of the work, and not to result in avoidable higher rates or costs. In case
of a significant number of variation orders or unexpectedly rapid cost escalation, updation may
be done more frequently. The financial statements should bring out comparisons of the initial
estimated/ tendered cost with the actual cost -- component- and activity --wise -- both with
respect of quantities and value. The Procuring Entity should examine these statements
critically. If costs are likely to be exceeded, this should be anticipated, and a revised estimate
of cost prepared, with complete explanations, for approval by the CA.
6.5.1

Variations/ Extra/ Substituted Items

93

i)

Variation means: (a) increase or decrease in the quantity of any work included in the
BOQ of the contract; (b) omission of any such work (but not if the omitted work is to be
carried out by the procuring entity by another contractor); (c) change in the character or
quality or kind of any such work; (d) change in the levels, lines, position and dimensions
of any part of the works; (e) additional work of any kind necessary for the completion of
the works; and (f) change of the specified sequence or timing of construction of any part
of the works. The variation or additional work must be a necessary part within the scope
of the original works and should not completely change the scope/ character and
purpose of the original contract. The variation may result in additional or reduced
payments to the contractor or there may be no price change at all. It is important to have
a written procedure as part of the contract, for the issuing of a variation instruction. Once
it is decided that a variation is required, the instruction should be issued promptly to
minimise any adverse effect on the overall works. Before a variation can be instructed
by the Engineer to the contractor, prior approval from the Procuring Entity is needed,
except for certain situations as may be specified in SCC. The rate/ price/ valuation do
not have to be agreed with the contractor, although this is preferable. Any change in
'approval for construction' drawings should be evaluated properly and their full financial
implications worked out at that very stage for submission to the appropriate authority for
approval. In case there are changes in ground levels from those shown in the approved
drawings, they shall be agreed in writing, jointly by the contractor and engineer and
reported to the Procuring Entity for considering whether any action lies against the
design consultant for non-conformity of the levels as shown by him in the drawings and
those actually obtaining.

ii)

Keeping Track of Variations/ Extra/ Substituted Items: The variations register shall
be used to administer and keep track of the status of a variation. Normally, the contractor
has a tendency to report and claim positive variations (variations causing higher
payments) and may not report negative variations. However, the engineer and Procuring
Entity must keep track of such negative variations and issue timely letters. This shall
cover the following important steps:

iii)

a)

The Procuring Entity's prior approval of the issue of the variation instruction;

b)

The engineer's instruction to the contractor (this letter creates the variation).
Particular details of a variation are not entered into the variations register until
the day the instruction is issued. Prior to that it is only a 'proposed variation' and
is tracked/ administered in a separate register;

c)

The variation instruction letter must be given a unique variation number and
details entered into the variation register;

d)

The register is updated at the end of each month and summarised on one sheet
as 'variation status', so that the involved agencies are aware as to what work
needing action is held up with each of them; and

e)

The financial implications are kept up to date.

Valuation of Variations: While taking decision with regards to variations a balance
should be maintained between the perceived risks in quick finalisation of variations
against the opportunity costs of delayed decision making e.g. project delays, cost
escalations, loss of transparency etc. Variation instructions for modified, new or

94

additional work involving extra cost shall be valued as per the procedure set out in the
relevant clauses of the contract. The following are the steps to be taken by the Engineer:
a)

To form an opinion as to the applicability of the rates in BOQ and if considered
applicable, to use BOQ rates;

b)

If not considered applicable, to use BOQ rates as the basis for valuation;

c)

In the event of a disagreement, to consult with procuring entity and contractor to
try and agree on suitable rates; this means developing new rates from first
principles;

d)

If there is disagreement, to fix the appropriate rate; and

e)

To determine provisional rates to allow monthly certification.

In making his recommendations, the engineer should give the contractor the opportunity
to state his case and, if he considers the BOQ rate to be inappropriate, to present his
proposals as to how the rate should be adjusted or what basis should be used to assess
a new price. For his part, the contractor must support his submission with full particulars
including, where applicable, a detailed cost breakdown of any rate in BOQ. The
Procuring Entity must also be consulted with. The Procuring Entity should ensure that
the above procedure has been duly followed and appropriately explained by the
engineer in his recommendations, before he approves the variation. Where it is
reasonable to value at the BOQ rate or some modification of it, any stance by the
contractor that the tendered price may be 'wrong' or deliberately set low is irrelevant.
The threshold level of the value/ quantity of a varied item below which a variation will not
merit re-fixation of rate or price should be specified in the SBD.
In case the engineer, while doing valuation of variations, notices significant cost and
time over-runs due to deviations between actual ground situation and the situation
recorded in DPR, he must bring to Procuring Entity’s notice the reach-wise differences
and the Ministry/ Department may consider stringent action against the consultant who
has prepared such DPRs as per para 2.4.2.
6.5.2

Measurement and Payment

i)

Measurements of all items having financial value shall be recorded in Measurement
books (MB) and/ or level field books so that a complete record is obtained of all works
performed under the contract. Measurements and levels shall be taken jointly by the
official designated for the purpose and the contractor. Electronic Management Books
( e-MBs) : Organisations as early as possible implement e- MBs and same should be
integrated with IT based project monitoring system.

ii)

Interim Payments: At a prearranged date each month, the contractor will submit a
statement in such a form as the engineer from time to time prescribes showing the
amounts to which the contractor considers himself entitled up to the end of the month.
The engineer's would issue an Interim Payment Certificate (IPC) after following
checks:
a)
b)

Quantity of work actually completed as of an agreed 'cut-off’ date;
Reconciliation with Field measurements of quantities of work completed or
claimed;

95

c)

Inventory of equipment and materials delivered to the site but not yet used in
the work (materials on site);
Review of claims for extra work;
Checking of retention amount and other recoveries;
Review of variations - whether these have been approved by Procuring Entity.
If not, provisional rates are to be used until final valuation sanctioned by
Procuring Entity; and
Price adjustments;
Following the bills filed by the contractor, Interim monthly payments (net of: (i)
retentions and recovery of advances; and (ii) statutory deductions (works tax,
income tax, others) would be made based on IPC. The engineer will not be
bound to certify any payment if the net amount thereof, after all retentions and
deductions, is less than the minimum amount of IPC, if any, specified in the
contract.

d)
e)
f)

g)
h)

iii)

As cash flow is a critical requirement in a project, payments delays impact the speed
of construction and also the future bid value as this is factored into the bid by way of
an increase in interest carry cost. Expenditure Management Committee constituted by
Government of India (headed by Dr. Bimal Jalan, eminent economist and public policy
experts) in its report has endorsed (recommendation no. 7644) the practice of releasing
a specified proportion (say Seventy-five percent - 75%) of the running milestone
payments, within a week of the bill being submitted, pending a detailed check on the
claim, in large projects. The balance is to be released after the claims are scrutinised
in detail as per procedure. If required an enabling provision may be incorporated in the
Conditions of Contract, possibly with stringent penalties in case of misuse of this
provision. In this regards the committee had reported that Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
(DMRC) has instituted such a system and it is stated to have helped in getting both a
speedier execution and more competitive bids.

iv)

45

Final bill shall be submitted by the contractor in same manner as that in interim bills
within a specified time of physical completion of work and of final certificate of
completion furnished by the Department/ Ministry. Payment shall then be made after
verification of the bill on the personal certificate of the officer-in-charge of execution of
the work in the format given below:
“I …... Executing Officer of (Name of the Work), am personally satisfied that the work
has been executed as per the specifications laid down in the Contract Agreement and
the workmanship is up to the standards followed in the Industry.”

v) Delay in payment to the contractors
a)

Delay in eligible payments to contractors leads to delay in execution of
projects, cost overruns and disputes. Hence, ad-hoc payments of not less
than 75% of eligible running account bill/ due stage payment, shall be made
within 10 working days of the submission of the bill. This period of 10 days is
for completion of all processes including prima facie scrutiny and certification
by the engineer in-charge (as declared by procuring entities). The remaining
payment is also to be made after final checking of the bill within 28 working

44

DoE OM No. 16/1/2016-PPD dated 24th August, 2016
Rule 139(vii), GFR, 2017

45

96

days of submission of bill by the contractor. In case the payment has not
been released within 10 working days as prescribed above, it shall be made
as soon as possible, and after payment a written explanation for the delay
shall be submitted to the next higher authority within three working days.
b) Public authorities may put in place a provision for payment of interest in case
of delayed payment of bills by more than 30 working days after submission of
bill by the contractor. Where interest is to be paid, the rate of interest should
be the rate of interest of General Provident Fund.
c) In case of unwarranted discretionary delays in payments, including failure to
authorise/ make ad hoc payment as prescribed in para 12.1 above,
responsibility shall be fixed on the concerned officers. Project executing
authorities should have a system to monitor delays in payments and to identify
such unwarranted delays.
d) The final bill should also be paid to the contractor within three months after
completion of work.
e) All project executing authorities implementing works contracts involving
aggregate payments of more than Rs.100 crore per annum shall have an
online system for monitoring of the bills submitted by contractors. Such
system shall have the facility for contractors to track the status of their bills. It
shall be mandatory for all contractors bills to be entered into the system with
date of submission and date of payment. Such system shall be put in place
within one year of issue of these instructions.)
Note: In para 6.5.2 (v) instructions containing “shall” are mandatory; any deviation from these
instructions shall require relaxation from Ministry of Finance (for Ministries/ Departments etc.)
or from the Board of Directors (for Central Public Sector Enterprises).
6.5.3

Mobilisation Advance

i)

If considered justified in certain specialized and capital intensive works, Contract may
provide for an interest-bearing mobilisation advance to be paid to the contractor
exclusively for the costs of mobilisation at 10 (ten) per cent of the contract price on the
provision by the contractor of an unconditional BG. Such BGs shall remain effective
until the advance payment has been fully repaid, but the amount thereof shall be
progressively reduced by the amount repaid by the contractor, as indicated in the
interim payment certificates.

ii)

The aforesaid advance of 10 (ten) per cent may be paid in two instalments, each of
five per cent. The first one may be paid on commencement of the work and provision
by the contractor of the unconditional BG in respect of the advance. The second
instalment may be paid on certification by the engineer of the contractor's having
achieved a financial progress of 10 (ten) per cent of the contract price, as also provision
of a BG by the contractor for this part of the advance. Mobilisation expenditure
mentioned herein shall not include the margin money and bank commission, and so
on, paid by the contractor for procurement of BGs against performance security and
mobilisation advance.

97

iii)

Provision of mobilization advance should essentially be need-based. Suitable
delegation of authority may be done in the Organisation to take decision for grant of
the mobilisation advance, whether interest free or interest bearing.

iv)

Though the Commission does not encourage interest free mobilization advance, but,
if the Management feels it necessity in specific cases then it should be clearly
stipulated in the tender document and its recovery should be time based not linked
with progress of work. This would ensure that even if the contractor is not executing
the work or executing it at a slow pace, recovery of advance could commence and
scope for misuse of such advance could be reduced.

v)

Part ‘Bank Guarantees’ (BGs) against the mobilization advance should be taken in as
many numbers as the proposed recovery instalments and should be equivalent to the
amount of each instalment. This would ensure that at any point of time even if the
contractor’s money on account of work done is not available with the organization,
recovery of such advance could be ensured by encashing the BG for the work
supposed to be completed within a particular period of time.

vi)

There should be a clear stipulation of interest to be charged on delayed recoveries
either due to the late submission of bill by the contractor or any other reason besides
the reason giving rise to the encashment of BG, as stated above.

vii)

The amount of mobilization advance, interest to be charged, if any; its recovery
schedule and any other relevant detail should be explicitly stipulated in the tendered
document upfront.

viii)

Relevant format for BG should be provided in the tender document, which should be
enforced strictly and authenticity of such BGs should also be invariably verified from
the issuing bank, confidentially and independently by the organization.

ix)

In case of ‘Machinery and Equipment advance’, insurance and hypothecation to the
employer should be ensured.

x)

Utilization certificate from the contractor for the mob advance should be obtained.
Preferably, mob adv should be given in instalments and subsequent instalments
should be released after getting satisfactory utilization certificate from the contractor
for the earlier instalment.

6.5.4

Plant, Machinery and shuttering Material Advance

Another interest-bearing advance of five per cent of the contract price, depending on the merits
of the case, may be paid against the new key construction equipment purchased for the work
and brought to the site, if so provided in the Bid Documents and so requested by the
contractor. The advance should normally not be more than 50 (fifty) percent of the depreciated
cost of such plants and machinery should be hypothecated to the Govt., before the payment
of advance is released. This advance shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) the
contractor shall produce satisfactory proof of payment; (ii) such equipment is considered
necessary by the engineer for the works; (iii) the equipment has been verified to have been
brought to site; (iv) the contractor gives an undertaking on stamp paper that the equipment
will work only on that job and will not be removed from the site without obtaining written
approval from the engineer; and (v) the contractor furnishes a BG to cover the advance. No
advance shall be admissible on equipment purchased under a hire purchase scheme/
financing arrangement or on hired equipment.

98

The rate of interest shall be stipulated in the bid documents (say 10 (ten) per cent per annum)
or as may be notified by the Procuring Agency from time to time.
The repayment of advances shall be done through proportionate percentage deductions from
running bill (periodic/ interim payment). The time of commencement of repayment, rate of
deductions from interim payments, and time by which the advance should be fully repaid will
be as specified in the contract.
All advances shall be used by the contractor exclusively for mobilisation expenditure, including
the acquisition of construction-related plant and equipment. Should the contractor
misappropriate any portion of the advance, it shall become due and payable immediately, and
no further advance will be made to the contractor thereafter. In such cases, the contractor
shall also be liable for appropriate action under the contract.
6.5.5

Secured Advance against Material brought to Site

Secured advance on the security of materials (which are not combustible, fragile or perishable
in nature) brought to the site but not yet incorporated in the works will be made up to 75
(seventy-five) per cent of invoice value, or the 75 (seventy-five) per cent of the corresponding
value of the materials determined on the basis of BOQ rates, whichever is less, subject to the
condition that their quantities are not excessive and shall be used within a period of 90 (ninety)
days and subject to other stipulations in the contract. The contractor will be required to sign
an indenture bond, hypothecating the goods to the procuring entity, and also be responsible
for their safe custody. Before the advance is released, the procuring entity may inspect the
site to ensure that the Contractor has safeguarded the materials against pilferage and
deterioration. It may be ensured that the contractor has not taken any loan/ limit from banks
against hypothecation of the materials against which the secured advance is claimed. An
undertaking in this regard may also be taken from the contractor.
Generally, as per the provisions of the contracts, the contractors are required to submit proof
of cost of materials and the delivery of material at site while claiming such advances. The
stock register should be maintained from the commencement of the contract and, unless
otherwise prescribed in the contracts, the stock, so considered for advance, should generally
be only paid stock (and not brought on credit). Where the materials are supplied from a captive
source of the contractor, the reasonableness of the valuation of such materials may be
ensured.
The advance will be repaid from each succeeding running bill (periodic/ interim payment) to
the extent materials for which advance has been previously paid have been incorporated into
the works. In all cases, the repayment of the advance will be affected after expiry of a period
of 120 days since payment of advance, whether the material is consumed in the work or not.
6.5.6

Price Variation

This will deal with rise and fall of the prices in construction materials/ labour and other key
inputs. However, this shall not be applicable in the contracts where period of completion is
eighteen months or less. The provision of price variation clauses enables contractors to factor
this reduced risk and quote more competitive prices.
The amount payable to the contractor shall be adjusted in respect of the rise or fall in the cost
of labour, Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POL) and materials to the work for which
appropriate formulae shall be prescribed in the contract and shall form part of the tender
document.

99

To the extent that full compensation for any rise or fall in costs to the contractor is not covered
by the provisions of the contract, the unit rates and prices included in the contract shall be
deemed to include amounts to cover the contingencies of such uncovered portion of rise or
fall of costs.
The formulae may be based on weightages of the material/ labour/ POL and cost indices/ base
prices. Indices shall be appropriate for their purpose and shall relate to the contractor’s
proposed source of supply of inputs on the basis of which his contract price shall have been
computed.
If any statutory regulations or bye-laws come into force after submission of the bids, which
cause additional or reduced cost to the contractor in the execution of the contract, such
statutory additional or reduced cost (except which are covered in cost indices) shall be added
or deducted from the contract price.
Short-term contracts where the delivery period does not extend beyond 18 (eighteen) months
should normally be concluded with a firm and price fixed by inviting tenders accordingly.
However, even for shorter deliveries, the price adjustment [or Price Variation Clause (PVC)]
may be stipulated for items with inputs (raw material, man power, etc.), prone to short-term
price volatility - especially for critical or high value works – otherwise there is a possibility of
the contract failing or the purchaser having to pay a higher price if prices fall.
Where it is decided to conclude the contract with a variable price, an appropriate clause
incorporating, inter-alia, a suitable price variation formula should also be provided in the tender
documents, to calculate the price variation between the base level and scheduled delivery
date. It is best to proactively provide our own PVC in the tender document to discourage
different bidders quoting different formulae and different base dates, which may lead to
problems on bringing their prices on a common comparable footing.
The variations are to be calculated periodically by using indices published by Governments/
chambers of commerce/London Metal Exchange / any other neutral and fair source of indices.
Suitable weights are to be assigned to the applicable elements, that is, fixed overheads and
profits, material and labour in the price variation formula. If the production of goods needs
more than one raw material, the input cost of material may be further sub-divided for different
categories of material, for which cost indices are published.
The following are important elements of PVC:
a)

The price agreed upon should specify the base date, that is, the month and year to
which the price is linked to enable variations being calculated with reference to the
price indices prevailing in that month and year;

b)

The price variation formula must also stipulate a minimum percentage of variation of
the contract price, only above which the price variation will be admissible (for example,
where the resultant increase is lower than, say, two per cent of the contract price, no
price adjustment will be made in favour of the supplier);

c)

The price variation clause should provide for a ceiling on price variations, particularly
where escalations are involved. It could be a percentage per annum or an overall
ceiling or both;

100

d)

Where advance or stage payments are made there should be a further stipulation that
no price variations will be admissible on such portions of the price, after the dates of
such payment;

e)

Where deliveries are accepted beyond the scheduled delivery date subject to levy of
liquidated damages as provided in the contract. The LD (if a percentage of the price)
will be applicable on the price as varied by the operation of the PVC;

f)

No upward price variation will be admissible beyond the original scheduled delivery
date for defaults on the part of the supplier. However, a downward price variation would
be availed by the purchaser as per the denial clause in the letter of extension of the
delivery period;

g)

Price variation may be allowed beyond the original scheduled delivery date, by specific
alteration of that date through an amendment to the contract in cases of force majeure
or defaults by Government;

h)

Where contract execution depends on imported (subject to customs duty and foreign
exchange fluctuations) and/or locally sourced goods/ works/ services (subject to
customs duty and foreign exchange fluctuations) and/or locally manufactured (subject
to excise duty and other duties and taxes), the percentage and element of duties and
taxes included in the price should be specifically stated, along with the selling rate of
foreign exchange element taken into account in the calculation of the price of the
imported item;

i)

The clause should also contain the mode and terms of payment of the price variation
admissible; and

j)

The buyer should ensure a provision in the contract for the benefit of any reduction in
the price in terms of the PVC being passed on to him.

k)

An illustrative PVC clause is available in Annexure 14.

l)

Care should be exercised in contracts providing for price variation to finalise the price
before final payment is made, after obtaining data and documents in support of claims
for escalation, if any. Where no such claims are submitted by the suppliers, an
examination of whether there has been a downward trend in the cost, which the
contractor may not bring out, is required. At any rate, an undertaking should be
obtained from the contractor to the following effect in case it becomes necessary to
make the final payment before he has submitted the required data/documents related
to the PVC:
“It is certified that there has been no decrease in the price of price variation
indices and, in the event of any decrease of such indices during the currency
of this contract, we shall promptly notify this to the purchaser and offer the
requisite reduction in the contract rate.”

m)

Notwithstanding the above formalities, it should be appreciated that it is in the interest
of the purchaser to be vigilant about downward variation and it is, therefore, the basic
responsibility of the purchase officers to make sure that the benefits of downward
variation, wherever it occurs, are fully availed of.

6.6

Commissioning and Documentation

101

6.6.1 When the work has been executed, the assets created shall be commissioned.
Reasonable advance information of completion of work should be given to the concerned
Ministry/ Department to enable them to make arrangements for taking over. The Ministry/
Department may carry out detailed inspection of the commissioned project to ensure that no
deficiencies are there before taking over. “As built” drawings of the work shall be got prepared
through the contractor or otherwise to facilitate proper maintenance of the assets, additions to
the assets at subsequent dates etc. and to form part of the records of the Ministry/ Department.
6.6.2 The Contractor/ PWO/ PSU would be responsible for obtaining Completion/
Occupancy Certificates/ Clearances and No-Objection-Certificates (NOCs), if applicable, from
the local civic authorities. For completed Work and Facilities before handing over the same to
‘Procuring Entity’ for putting them to functional use.
6.6.3 Before the completed work is taken over by the Ministry/ Department, it must ensure
that the Contractor restores to original status - the auxiliary services/ facilities (Roads,
Sewerage, utilities, including removal of garbage and debris) affected during the construction
process.
6.6.4. The Contractor/ PWO/ PSU shall hand over to Ministry/ Department concerned or its
Authorized Representative completed Work including all Services and Facilities constructed
in accordance with the Approved Plans, Specifications fulfilling all agreed techno-functional
requirements along with Inventory, As built - Drawings, Maintenance Manual/ Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP) for Equipments and Plants, all clearances /Certificates from
Statutory Authorities, Local Bodies etc.
6.6.5. On completion of the work, a Project Completion Report (PCR) shall be submitted by
The Contractor/ PWO/ PSU duly bringing out the Final Project Completion Cost, Total Time
period taken to complete the work and also completed Project Components as against the
approved Cost, Time and Project Components. The PCR shall be submitted along with Final
Project Accounts including return of unspent balance amount to the Ministry/ Department
within one month of settlement of final bills of the contractors/ other agencies deployed on the
work.
6.6.6. Record keeping should be created at every work centre to facilitate proper stacking of
records pertaining to the completed works. The records should be preserved in such a manner
that the same can be retrieved whenever required.

6.7

Closure of Contract

6.7.1

Completion of Contract

The contract is not to be treated as completed until a Defects Liability Certificate (DLC) has
been issued. There will be only one DLC. It will be issued when the contractor has completed
all his obligations under the contract. While making the final payment to the contractor and
before releasing the PBG, it should be ensured that there is nothing outstanding from the
contractor, because it would be difficult to retrieve such amounts after releasing the bank
guarantee/ final payment. Before the bank guarantee is released a “no claim certificate” may
be taken from the contractor as per the format given in Annexure 7. At least in large contracts
(above Rs. 25 (twenty-five) lakh), it should be ensured that before the release of the bank
guarantee (final payment, if there is no bank guarantee), the following reconciliations should
be done across departments involved in the execution of the contract:
6.7.2

Material and Works Reconciliation

102

The Ministry/ Department should confirm that all Works ordered in the contract and paid for
have been taken over in good condition and there is no shortcoming. Full reconciliation of all
materials, machinery and assets provided to the contractor should be done including wastages
and return of scrap/ off-cuts.
6.7.3 Reconciliation with the User Department
Besides Works reconciliation, the user department should certify in writing that the following
activities (wherever applicable) have been completed by the contractor, to the department’s
satisfaction, as per the contract:

i) Achievement of performance standards of Work;
ii) Installation and commissioning, if any;
iii) Support service during the Defect Liability Period which has ended on ______;
iv) As Made Drawings;
v) Return of all ID cards, gate passes, documents, drawings, protective gear, material,
equipment, facilities and assets loaned to contractor.
6.7.4

Payment Reconciliation

The Ministries/ Departments may reconcile payments made to the contractor to ensure that
there is no liability outstanding against the contractor on account of:

i) LD;
ii) Price reduction enforced on account of shortfall in standards of Work;
iii) Variations/ deviations from the scope of the contract;
iv) Overpayments/ duplicate payments, if any;
v) Services availed from Procuring Entity and vacation thereof such as accommodation,
electricity, water, security, transport, cranes and other machinery, and so on,
Demurrage, insurance premiums or claims, and so on;
Works reconciliation;
Price variations;
Statutory duties paid on behalf of the contractor by Procuring Entity; and

vi)
vii)
viii)
ix)

On satisfactory reconciliation and against a “no claim certificate” from the contractor, the bank
guarantee may be released and its acknowledgement taken from the contractor.

6.8

Dispute Resolution Mechanism

6.8.1 Normally, there should not be any scope for dispute between the Procuring Entity and
contractor after entering into a mutually agreed valid contract. However, due to various
unforeseen reasons, problems may arise during the progress of the contract leading to a
disagreement between the procuring entity and contractor. When a dispute/ difference arise,
both the procuring entity and contractor should first try to resolve it amicably by mutual
consultation failing which Dispute Resolution process should be invoked. The dispute
resolution method shall be specified clearly in the bidding document. It may be through a
Disputes Resolution Board. Dispute Resolution Mechanism for PPP projects is to be
specifically provided in the Concession Agreement whereby if mediation does not succeed
then Arbitration under the Arbitration and Reconciliation Act is to be provided for.
6.8.2 If a dispute of any kind, whatsoever, arises between the procuring entity and contractor
in connection with or arising out of the contract or the execution of the works, whether during

103

the execution of the works or after their completion and whether before or after the repudiation
or termination of the contract, including any disagreement by either party with any action, in
action, opinion, instruction, determination, certificate or valuation of the Engineer; the matter
in dispute shall, in the first place, be referred to the Dispute Resolution Board.
6.8.3 The Works Committee may act as Dispute Resolution Board. The board may co-opt
any other officer, if required for dispute resolution.

6.9

Conciliation

The party initiating conciliation shall send a written invitation to the other party to conciliate
and proceedings shall commence when the other party accepts the initiations to conciliation.
The parties may agree on the name of a sole conciliator or each party may appoint one
conciliator. The conciliation shall assist the parties to reach an amicable settlement of their
dispute. When the parties sign the settlement agreement, it shall be final and binding on the
parties. The conciliator shall authenticate the settlement agreement and furnish a copy thereof
to each party.

6.10

Arbitration

If an amicable settlement is not forthcoming, recourse may be taken to the settlement of
disputes through arbitration as per the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 as amended by
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015. For this purpose, when the contract is
with a domestic contractor, a standard arbitration clause may be included in the SBD indicating
the arbitration procedure to be followed. All questions and disputes relating to the meaning of
the specifications, design, drawings and instructions here-in and as to the quality of
workmanship or materials used on the work or as to any other question, claim, right, matter or
thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to the contract, designs, drawings,
specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or these conditions or otherwise concerning the
works or the execution or failure to execute the same whether arising during the progress of
the work or after the cancellation, termination, completion or abandonment thereof shall be
referred to adjudication through arbitration. Please refer to Appendix 3 for further details of the
Arbitration Act.
It is therefore essential that the Project Organisation of the Procuring Entity and Engineer be
aware of potential arbitration clauses and ensure that crucial documentation including site
records, quantity records, handover of site etc. are recorded and secured properly for future
use.
6.10.1 Arbitration and dispute resolution
i)

During operation of the contracts, issues and disputes arising due to lack of clarity in
the contract become the root cause of litigation. Litigation has adverse implications on
the timelines and overall cost of the project. Before resorting to arbitration/litigation,
the parties may opt for mutual discussion, mediation, and Conciliation for the resolution
of disputes.

ii)

Arbitration /court awards should be critically reviewed. In cases where there is a
decision against government / public sector enterprise (PSE), the decision to appeal
should not be taken in a routine manner, but only when the case genuinely merits going
for the appeal and there are high chances of winning in the court/ higher court. There
is a perception that such appeals etc. are sometimes resorted to postpone the problem
and defer personal accountability. Casual appealing in arbitration / court cases has
resulted in payment of heavy damages / compensation / additional interest cost,

104

thereby causing more harm to the exchequer, in addition to tarnishing the image of the
Government.
(iii)

The Organisation should monitor the success rate of appealing against arbitration
awards. There should be a clear delegation to empower officials to accept arbitration /
court orders. A special board / committee may be set up to review the case before an
appeal is filed against an order. Arbitration /court awards should not be routinely
appealed without due application of mind on all facts and circumstances including
realistic probability of success. The board / committee or other authority deciding on
the matter shall clarify that it has considered both legal merits and the practical
chances of success and after considering the cost of, and rising through, litigation /
appeal / further litigation as the case may be, it is satisfied that such litigation / appeal
/ further litigation cost is likely to be financially beneficial compared to accepting the
arbitration / court award.

iv)

Statistics have shown that in cases where the arbitration award is challenged, a large
majority of cases are decided in favour of the contractor. In such cases, the amount
becomes payable with the interest, at a rate which is often far higher than the
government's cost of funds. This results in huge financial losses to the government.
Hence, in aggregate, it is in public interest to take the risk of paying a substantial part
of the award amount subject to the result of the litigation, even if in some rare cases of
insolvency etc. recovery of the amount in case of success may become difficult.
Instructions have been issued in this matter in the past, but have not been fully
complied with.

(v)

The only circumstances in which such payment need not be made is where the
contractor declines, or is unable, to provide the requisite bank guarantee and/or fails
to open a escrow account as required. Persons responsible for not adhering to are
liable to be held personally accountable for the additional interest arising, in the event
of the final court order going against the procuring entity.

6.10.2 Arbitration Awards

i)

In cases where the Ministry/ Department has challenged an arbitral award and,
as a result, the amount of the arbitral award has not been paid, 75% of the arbitral
award (which may include interest up to date of the award) shall be paid by the Ministry/
Department to the contractor/ concessionaire against a Bank Guarantee (BG). The BG
shall only be for the said 75% of the arbitral award as above and not for the interest
which may become payable to the Ministry/ Department should the subsequent court
order require refund of the said amount.
Note: In para 6.10.2 (i) instructions containing “shall” are mandatory; any deviation
from these instructions shall require relaxation from Ministry of Finance (for Ministries/
Departments etc.) or from the Board of Directors (for Central Public Sector
Enterprises).

ii) The payment may be made into a designated Escrow Account with the stipulation that
the proceeds will be used first, for payment of lenders' dues, second, for completion of
the project and then for completion of other projects of the same Ministry/ Department
as mutually agreed/ decided. Any balance remaining in the escrow account
subsequent to settlement of lenders' dues and completion of projects of the Ministry/

105

Department may be allowed to be used by the contractor/ concessionaire with the prior
approval of the lead banker and the Ministry/ Department. If otherwise eligible and
subject to contractual provisions, retention money and other amounts withheld may
also be released against BG.]46

6.11

Breach of Contract, Remedies and Termination

6.11.1 Breach of Contract
In case the contractor is unable to honour important stipulations of the contract, or gives notice
of his intention of not honouring or his inability to honour such a stipulation, a breach of contract
is said to have occurred. Mostly, such breaches occur in relation to the performance of the
contract in terms of inability to complete the Work within stipulated time. It could also be due
to breach of ethical standards or any other stipulation that affects Procuring Entity seriously.
As soon as a breach of contract is noticed, a show cause notice should be issued to the
contractor, giving two weeks’ notice, reserving the right to implement contractual remedies. If
there is an unsatisfactory resolution, remedial action may be taken immediately.
If termination takes place because of a fundamental breach/ insolvency on the part of the
contractor, the engineer shall issue a certificate for the value of work done, deducting from the
amounts in respect of: (i) advance payments; (ii) any recoveries; (iii) taxes as due; and (iv)
percentage to apply to the work not completed as indicated in the contract data. If the total
amount due to the procuring entity exceeds that due to the contractor, the difference will be a
debt payable to the procuring entity. The CA may terminate a contract in the following cases.
The Procuring Entity is then free to take over the site and complete the works himself or with
another contractor and use the contractor's materials, equipment, temporary works as he/ they
think proper.
6.11.2 Cancellation of Contract for Default
Without prejudice to any other remedy for breach of contract, such as removal from the list of
enlisted contractor, by written notice of default sent to the Contractor, the contract may be
terminated in whole or in part, if the contractor has:

i) has seriously or repeatedly breached the contract, including
a)

failure to complete the work within the time period(s) specified in the contract, or
any extension thereof granted;
b)
failure to obey instructions in relation to his progress or defective work, material
or plant;
c)
breach of the prohibition against sub-contracting
d)
Failure to supply sufficient and suitable constructional plant, temporary works,
labour and material as proposed in the work programme;
e)
Substantial suspension of work for more than the specified days without authority
from the engineer and failure to proceed with the work within the specified days
of receipt of notice from the engineer
f)
Failure to comply with the requirements regarding JVs
ii) committed fraud
iii) If the contractor fails to perform any other obligation under the contract within the period
specified in the contract or any extension thereof granted.

New rule 227A of GFR, 2017 notified vide OM No. F./1/9/2021-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 29.10.2021.

106

iv) If the contract is terminated in whole or in part, recourse may be taken to any one or more
of the following actions:
a) Forfeiture of the performance security;
b) Upon such terms and in such manner as it deems appropriate, taking over the site and
to complete the works himself or with another contractor (risk Purchase) and use the
contractor's materials, equipment, temporary works as he/ they think proper. In small
value contracts, instead of Risk Purchase, a fixed percentage recovery may be
provided in the SBD; and
c) However, the contractor shall continue to fulfil the contract to the extent not terminated.
Before cancelling the contract and taking further action, it may be desirable to obtain legal
advice.
6.11.3 Termination of Contract for Insolvency
If the contractor becomes bankrupt or becomes otherwise insolvent or undergoes liquidation
or loses substantially the technical or financial capability (based on which he was selected for
award of contract), at any time, the contract may be terminated, by giving a written notice to
the contractor, without compensation to the contractor, provided that such termination will not
prejudice or affect any right of action or remedy which has accrued or will accrue thereafter to
Procuring Entity.
6.11.4 Termination of Contract for Procuring Entity’s Failure or Convenience
After placement of the contract, there may be an unforeseen situation compelling Procuring
Entity to cancel the contract. In such a case, a suitable notice has to be sent to the contractor
for cancellation of the contract, in whole or in part, for its (Procuring Entity’s) convenience,
inter alia, indicating the date with effect from which the termination will to become effective.
This is not Procuring Entity’s legal right– the contractor has to be persuaded to acquiesce.
Depending on the merits of the case, the contractor may have to be suitably compensated on
mutually agreed terms for terminating the contract. Suitable provisions to this effect should be
to be incorporated in the tender document as well as in the resultant contract. If termination
occurs because of Procuring Entity's convenience or a fundamental breach on his part, the
engineer will certify the value of works executed, value of any materials lying at site,
reasonable cost of removal of equipment, repatriation of project staff, cost of protecting and
securing the works and deducting from it: (i) pending advances; (ii) other recoveries; and (iii)
taxes as due.

6.12

Preparation of Revised Project Report

As per GFR, 2017, Rule 141, for project costing Rs. 100 crore or above the Administrative
Ministry or Department will set up a Review Committee consisting of a representative each
from the Administrative Ministry, Finance (Internal Finance Wing) and the Executing Agency
to review the progress of the work. The Review Committee shall have the powers to accept
variation within 10% of the approved estimates. For works costing less than Rs. 100 crore, it
will be at the discretion of the Administrative Ministry/Department to set up a suitable
mechanism for review and acceptance of variation within 10% of the approved estimates.
On the lines of provisions in Ministry of Finance (DoE)’s instructions vide OM No. 24(35)/PFII/2012 dated 05/08/2016 regarding appraisal and approval of Public Funded projects/
schemes, any increase in costs due to statutory levies, exchange rate variation, price
escalation within the approved time cycle and/ or increase in costs upto 20 percent due to any

107

other reason, are covered by the approval of the original cost estimates. Any increase in this
regard would be approved by the Secretary of the Administrative Department concerned with
the concurrence of the Financial Adviser.
Any increase in costs beyond 20 percent of the firmed-up cost estimates due to time overrun,
change in scope, under-estimation, etc. (excluding increase in costs due to statutory levies,
exchange rate variation and price escalation within the approved time cycle) should first be
placed before a Revised Cost Committee chaired by the Financial Adviser (consisting of the
Joint Secretary in-charge of the program division and representative of the Chief Adviser Cost
as members) to identify the specific reasons behind such increase, identify lapses, if any, and
suggest remedial measures for the same. The recommendations of the Revised Cost
Committee should be placed for fresh appraisal and approval before the authority as per the
extant delegation of powers (It may be noted that a firmed-up cost estimate here means a cost
estimate which has been through the full appraisal and approval procedure as per the extant
delegation of powers).
When the variation/ excess occurs at such an advanced period in the construction of a work47
as to render the submission of a revised estimate purposeless, the completion report may
explain the excess and an Officer of status not lower than that of Superintending Engineer (of
PWO/ PSU) may pass the completion report, if the total expenditure in question is not greater
than that which he is empowered to sanction in the case of a revised estimate.

Issues
7.1

Contractor Relationship Management

Contractor Relationship Management comprises the following functions:

i)

Ensuring compliance of contractors to the Code of Integrity for Public Procurement and
Integrity Pact (CIPP) if stipulated in Bid Documents;

ii)

Holiday listing; removal from the list of enlisted contractors and banning/ debarment of
firms; and

iii)

Development of new sources and registration/ enlistment of contractors.

7.2

Code of Integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP)

7.2.1

Introduction

Public procurement is perceived to be prone to corruption and ethical risks. To mitigate this,
the officials of Procuring Entities involved in procurement and the bidders/ contractors must
abide by the following Code of Integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP). All Procuring officials
may be asked to sign declarations to this effect periodically and in various Procurement
decisions (including Preparation of Estimates). The bidders/ contractors should be asked to
sign a declaration about abiding by a Code of Integrity for Public Procurement (including subcontractors engaged by them) in enlistment applications and in bid documents, with a warning
that, in case of any transgression of this code, its name is not only liable to be removed from
the list of enlisted contractors, but it would be liable for other punitive actions such as
cancellation of contracts, banning and blacklisting or action in Competition Commission of
India, and so on.
7.2.2

Code of Integrity for Public Procurement48

Procuring authorities as well as bidders, contractors and consultants should observe the
highest standard of ethics and should not indulge in the following prohibited practices, either
directly or indirectly, at any stage during the procurement process or during execution of
resultant contracts:
i)

“Corrupt practice”: making offers, solicitation or acceptance of bribe, rewards or gifts
or any material benefit, in exchange for an unfair advantage in the procurement
process or to otherwise influence the procurement process or contract execution;

ii)

“Fraudulent practice”: any omission or misrepresentation that may mislead or
attempt to mislead so that financial or other benefits may be obtained or an obligation
avoided. This includes making false declaration or providing false information for
participation in a tender process or to secure a contract or in execution of the contract;

iii)

“Anti-competitive practice”: any collusion, bid rigging or anti-competitive
arrangement, or any other practice coming under the purview of The Competition Act,
2002, between two or more bidders, with or without the knowledge of the procuring

48

Rule 175 (1), GFR 2017

109

entity, that may impair the transparency, fairness and the progress of the procurement
process or to establish bid prices at artificial, non-competitive levels;
iv)

“Coercive practice”: harming or threatening to harm, persons or their property to
influence their participation in the procurement process or affect the execution of a
contract;

v)

“Conflict of interest”: participation by a bidding firm or any of its affiliates that are
either involved in the consultancy contract to which this procurement is linked; or if
they are part of more than one bid in the procurement; or if the bidding firm or their
personnel have relationships or financial or business transactions with any official of
procuring entity who are directly or indirectly related to tender or execution process of
contract; or improper use of information obtained by the (prospective) bidder from the
procuring entity with an intent to gain unfair advantage in the procurement process or
for personal gain; and

vi)

“Obstructive practice”: materially impede the procuring entity’s investigation into
allegations of one or more of the above mentioned prohibited practices either by
deliberately destroying, falsifying, altering; or by concealing of evidence material to the
investigation; or by making false statements to investigators and/ or by threatening,
harassing or intimidating any party to prevent it from disclosing its knowledge of
matters relevant to the investigation or from pursuing the investigation; or by impeding
the procuring entity’s rights of audit or access to information;

7.2.3

Obligations for Proactive Disclosures49

i)

Procuring authorities as well as bidders, contractors and consultants, are obliged
under Code of Integrity for Public Procurement to suo-moto proactively declares any
conflicts of interest (coming under the definition mentioned above – pre-existing or as
and as soon as these arise at any stage) in any procurement process or execution of
contract. Failure to do so would amount to violation of this code of integrity; and

ii)

Any bidder must declare, whether asked or not in a bid document, any previous
transgressions of such a code of integrity with any entity in any country during the last
three years or of being debarred by any other procuring entity. Failure to do so would
amount to violation of this code of integrity.

iii)

To encourage voluntary disclosures, such declarations would not mean automatic
disqualification for the bidder making such declarations. The declared conflict of
interest may be evaluated and mitigation steps, if possible, may be taken by the
procuring entity. Similarly voluntary reporting of previous transgressions of Code of
Integrity elsewhere may be evaluated and barring cases of various grades of
debarment, an alert watch may be kept on the bidder’s actions in the tender and
subsequent contract.

7.2.4

Punitive Provisions50

Without prejudice to and in addition to the rights of the procuring entity to other penal
provisions as per the bid documents or contract, if the procuring entity comes to a conclusion
that a (prospective) bidder/ contractor directly or through an agent, has violated this code of
49

integrity in competing for the contract or in executing a contract, the procuring entity may take
appropriate measures including one or more of the following:

i)

If his bids are under consideration in any procurement
a)
Forfeiture or encashment of bid security;
b)
calling off of any pre-contract negotiations; and
c)
rejection and exclusion of the bidder from the procurement process
ii)
If a contract has already been awarded
a)
Cancellation of the relevant contract and recovery of compensation for loss
incurred by the procuring entity;

In case of anti-competitive practices, information for further processing may be
filed under a signature of the Joint Secretary level officer, with the Competition
Commission of India;
c)
Initiation of suitable disciplinary or criminal proceedings against any individual or
staff found responsible.
7.2.5 Conduct of Public Servants in Public Procurement - Risks and Mitigations
Risk
Hospitality:
Hospitality
(including
facilitation of travel, lodging, boarding and
entertainment during official or unofficial
programs) from suppliers may tend to
cross the limits of ethical/ occasional/
routine/ modest/ normal business
practice. Officials sent to firm’s premises
for inspections/ meetings may mistakenly
presume entitlement to hospitality from
the firm, even if other arrangements are
available at the location.

Mitigation
Hospitality must never be solicited, directly or
indirectly. The frequency, scale and number of
officials availing hospitality should not be
allowed to identify the recipient in a public way
with any particular contractor, supplier or
service provider or raise doubts about its
neutrality. It should not involve significant
travel, overnight accommodation or trips
abroad. Particular care should be taken in
relation to offers of hospitality from firms (say
participating in current or imminent tenders or
its execution) who stand to derive a personal or
commercial benefit from their relationship with
the recipient.

In the contracts signed with suppliers by
some of the Ministries/ Departments have
clauses of pre-inspection at the firm’s
premises, where there is a provision that
the suppliers or the vendors will pay for
the travel, stay, hospitality and other
expenses of the Inspecting officials.

This is not in keeping with need to safeguard
the independence of the inspecting teams.
Such provisions in contracts need to be
discouraged, so that Inspections are not
compromised. Necessary steps maybe taken

111

7.2.5 Conduct of Public Servants in Public Procurement - Risks and Mitigations
Risk

Mitigation
to strictly avoid such provisions in the contracts
with suppliers/ vendors51.

Gifts: Gifts from suppliers may tend to
cross the limits of ethical/ occasional/
routine/ modest/ normal business
practice, especially on festive season.
Since the value of the gift may not be
known to the recipient, it may cause
inadvertent violation of Conduct rules.

Gifts must never be solicited, directly or
indirectly. An official should not accept and
retain gifts more valuable than the limit as laid
down in the conduct rules. Cash, gift cheques
or any vouchers that may be exchanged for
cash may not be accepted regardless of the
amount. Particular care should be taken in
relation to gifts from firms (say participating in
current or imminent tenders or its execution)
who stand to derive a personal or commercial
benefit from their relationship with the recipient.
Any gift received inadvertently in violation of
above, must immediately either be returned or
else reported and deposited in Toshakhana/
Treasury.

Private Purchases from Official
Suppliers: Procuring Officials may
mistakenly consider it innocuous to seek
discounts in private procurements from
suppliers having official dealings or its
associates (especially from Rate Contract
holders).

Officials involved in Public Procurement must
never indulge in any non-official pecuniary
transaction with the contractors, suppliers or
service providers with whom they have official
dealings; including seeking or accepting
special facilities or discounts on private
purchases (particularly same items which are
being ordered officially on rate contracts).

Sponsorship of Events: Procuring
Officials may mistakenly consider it
innocuous to seek financial favours
(donations, advertisements for souvenirs,
and contributions in cash or kind) in
relation to sponsoring of cultural, social,
charitable, religious, or sporting events, in
the false belief that since he/ she is
personally not benefitted, it would not be
a violation of CIPP.

Officials involved in Public Procurement must
never indulge in any non-official pecuniary
transaction with the contractors, suppliers or
service providers with whom they have official
dealings; including soliciting of sponsorship for
unofficial and private cultural, social, sporting,
religious, charitable or similar organisations or
events.

7.3

Integrity Pact (IP)

The Pre-bid and Post-Contract Integrity Pact is a tool to help governments, businesses and
civil society to fight corruption in public contracting. It binds both procuring entities and sellers
to ethical conduct and transparency in all activities from pre-selection of bidders, bidding and
contracting, implementation, completion and operation related to the contract. This removes
51

Notified vide OM No.F.11/13/2017-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 24.10.2017

112

insecurity of Bidders, that while they themselves may abjure Bribery, but their competitors may
resort to it and win contract by unfair means.
Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure have mandated Ministries/ Departments and
their attached/ subordinate offices (including autonomous bodies) to incorporate Integrity Pact
by, depending on the nature of procurements/ contracts above a threshold value. The nature
of procurement and threshold of value is to be decided by the Ministries/ Departments with
approval of the Minister in charge. As guidance, the threshold should be such as to cover bulk
(80-90%) of its procurement expenditure.
The pact essentially envisages an agreement between the prospective contractors/ bidders
and the Procuring Entity, committing the persons/ officials of both sides, not to resort to any
corrupt practices in any aspect/ stage of the contract. Only those contractors/ bidders, who
commit themselves to such a Pact with the Procuring Entity, would be considered competent
to participate in the bidding process. In other words, entering into this Pact would be a
preliminary qualification. The essential ingredients of the Pact include:

i)

Promise on the part of the Procuring Entity to treat all bidders with equity and reason and
not to seek or accept any benefit, which is not legally available;

ii) Promise on the part of bidders not to offer any benefit to the employees of the Procuring
Entity not available legally and also not to commit any offence under Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 or Indian Penal Code 1860;

iii) Promise on the part of Bidders not to enter into any undisclosed agreement or
understanding with other bidders with respect to prices, specifications, certifications,
subsidiary contracts, etc.

iv) Undertaking (as part of Fall Clause) by the Bidders that they have not and will not sell the
same material/ equipment at prices lower than the bid price.

v) Foreign bidders to disclose the name and address of agents and representatives in India
and Indian Bidders to disclose their foreign principals or associates;

vi) Bidders to disclose the payments to be made by them to agents/ brokers or any other
intermediary.

vii) Bidders to disclose any past transgressions committed over the specified period with any
other company in India or Abroad that may impinge on the anti corruption principle.

viii) Integrity Pact lays down the punitive actions for any violation.
ix) IP would be implemented through a panel of Independent External Monitors (IEMs),
appointed by the organization in consultation with Central Vigilance Commission. The IEM
would review independently and objectively, whether and to what extent parties have
complied with their obligations under the Pact. Government of India organizations and
Public Sectors of implementing Integrity Pact are required to select at most three persons
(below the age of 70 (seventy) years) of high integrity and reputation as Independent
External Monitors (IEM) after due diligence and forward to the CVC for its approval. Only
those officers of Government of India departments or Public Sector Undertakings, who
have retired from top management positions, would be considered for appointment as
IEM, provided they are neither serving or retired from the same organization. Eminent
persons, retired judges of High/ Supreme Courts, executives of private sector of

113

considerable eminence could also be considered for functioning as Independent External
Monitors. The appointment of Independent External Monitors would be for an initial period
of three years and could be extended for another term of two years (maximum tenure of
five years). Names and contact details of the Independent External Monitor(s) should be
listed in Notice Inviting Tender (NIT).

x) In tenders meeting the criteria of threshold value/ nature of procurement - Integrity Pact
clause and format should be included in the Bid Documents. Each page of such Integrity
pact proforma would be duly signed by Procuring Entity’s competent signatory. All pages
of the Integrity Pact are to be returned by the bidder (along with the technical bid) duly
signed by the same signatory who signed the bid, i.e. who is duly authorized to sign the
bid and to make binding commitments on behalf of his company. Any bid not accompanied
by Integrity Pact duly signed by the bidder shall be considered to be a non-responsive bid
and shall be rejected straightway. Names and contact details of the Independent External
Monitor(s) should be listed in Notice Inviting Tender (NIT).
xi) Role/ Functions of IEMs: The Monitors would not be subject to instructions by the
representatives of the parties and should perform their functions neutrally and
independently. They would review independently and objectively, whether and to what
extent parties have complied with their obligations under the Integrity Pact. For this
purpose, they would have access to all contract documents/ books of accounts of the
bidders in case of any allegation of violation of any provisions of the Integrity Pact or
payment of commission, whenever required. The IEMs will have the option to participate
in such meetings among the parties related to the project provided such meetings could
have an impact on the contractual relations between the parties. Ideally all IEMs of an
organization should meet once every two months to take stock of ongoing tendering
process. The IEMs would examine all complaints received by them and give their
recommendations/ views to the designated officer of the Procuring Entity, at the earliest.
The Monitors would also inform the Procuring Entity, if they notice or have reason to
believe, a violation of the Integrity Pact. They may also send their report directly to the
Central Vigilance Commission, in case of suspicion of serious irregularities requiring legal/
administrative action. At least one IEM would be invariably cited in the NIT. However for
ensuring the desired transparency and objectivity in dealing with the complaints arising
out of any tendering process, the matter should be examined by the full panel of IEMs,
who would look into the records, conduct an investigation, and submit their joint
recommendations. The recommendations of IEMs would be in the nature of advice and
would not be legally binding. IEMs may not be equated with consultants in the Procuring
Entity. Their role is independent in nature and the advice once tendered would not be
subject to review. The role of the Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) of Procuring Entity shall
remain unaffected by the presence of IEMs. A matter being examined by the IEMs can
be separately investigated by the CVO, if a complaint is received by him or directed to
him by the CVC. As per para 5.13 of CVC OM No. 05/01/22 issued vide letter No.
015/VGL/091 dated 25.01.2022, in the event of any dispute between the management
and the contractor relating to those contracts where Integrity Pact is applicable, in case,
both the parties are agreeable, they may try to settle dispute through mediation before
the panel of IEMs in a time bound manner. If required, the organizations may adopt any
mediation rules for this purpose. In case, the dispute remains unresolved even after
mediation by the panel of IEMs, the organization may take further action as per the terms
& conditions of the contract.

7.4
Development of New Sources and Registration/ Enlistment of
Contractors
7.4.1

i)
ii)

The terms ‘enlistment’ and ‘registration’ may be differentiated as follows: -Registration: Simply registering the contractor, without any verification.
Enlistment: Including the name of the contractor in the list of after verification of
credentials.

7.4.2 Registration: All the Ministries/Departments shall register the prospective contractors
on their e-procurement portal or in the CPPP (in case they do not have their own eprocurement portal) before submitting their bids. The contractor may be an Individual, Sole
proprietorship firm, partnership firm, limited liability partnership, private or public limited
company. For registration, the Ministries/Department/CPSUs shall capture at least– (i) Name
of contractor, (ii) Address and Contact details, (iii) Permanent Account Number (PAN), (iv)
Details of digital signature certificate (DSC) and (v) GSTIN. Depending on the requirement of
respective procurement portal, the Ministries/Departments can capture any other information,
as may be considered necessary.
7.4.3 Enlistment: Some Departments such as Central Public Works Department (CPWD)
and Military Engineering Services (MES) are enlisting the contractors after verification of their
credentials. Such enlistment is used by CPWD for obtaining bids for small value tenders i.e.
up to Rs. 20 crores. For the tenders above Rs. 20 crores any contractor even if not enlisted
can participate in the tenders issued by the CPWD. It is expected that Ministries/Departments
will also develop their own enlistment process, as has been done by CPWD, Ministry of
Railways (MoR) and Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) to reduce the time
required for verification of credentials of the contractors after opening of the bids. The lists of
such enlisted contractors can be used by any Ministry/Department/CPSU.
7.4.4 The Ministries/Departments will also share the information of registered and enlisted
contractors with each other through the Central Public Procurement (CPPP). The
Ministries/Departments will also ensure that whenever a contractor is debarred, the
information regarding the same is made available immediately to all the
Ministries/Departments through the CPPP. The reasons for the debarment and order of such
debarment may also be displayed on the CPPP. The National Informatics Centre (NIC)/
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) shall make appropriate changes
in the CPPP so that each contractor can be uniquely identified by PAN. All the Ministries/
Departments may take cognizance of the information regarding debarment of contractors and
use it as an input for the decision making process as per their own procurement policies.
7.4.5 Ministries/ Departments with a significant volume of procurements may follow their own
policies and procedures for enlistment of contractors, if already existing. The policies and
procedures for enlistment described below is for guidance of Ministries/ Departments, who do
not have their own, laid down policies/ procedures for enlistment. The Ministry/ Department
shall notify the authorities competent to deal with the applications and grant enlistments, along
with their jurisdictions. The appellate authority shall be at least one level above the registering
authority or as designated by the Ministry/ Department.
7.4.6

Categories for Enlistment

In case of procurement of works, the Administrative Department shall enlist firms as
contractors of goods in different types/ categories of works (Civil, Electrical, Horticulture,

115

Furniture, Nursery etc). The contractor may be a Private, Partnership, Pvt Ltd, Corporate, PSU
or a Joint Venture company.
7.4.7

Class of Enlistment (Tendering Limits)

Enlistment should be done by Class of the firms (Grade A, B, and so on) on their capability for
executing contract orders of different monetary limits in the relevant category of requirements.
The monetary limits should be carefully fixed keeping in view the banker’s reports, capacity
and capability of the firm and other financial information indicated in the balance sheets, profit
and loss statements:
(A sample classification - Source CPWD website)

7.4.8 Procedure for Enlistment: Enlistment of contractors should be done by any Ministry/
Department in case it desires to enlist contractors for works which are exclusively needed by
it by keeping fundamental principles of public procurement in view (especially the transparency
principle - transparency, fairness, equality, competition and appeal rights) with the approval of
CA after carefully assessing and verifying credentials, capability, quality control systems, past
performance, after-sales service facilities, financial background, and so on, of the contractor/
service provider(s):

i)

Details of the procedure for enlistment of new firms may be uploaded on the website
and also published in the form of a booklet for information of the contractors.
Timeframes and criteria for enlistment of new contractors may be clearly indicated;

ii)

Possible sources for any category/ group of requirements can be identified based on
internal and external references. Data of new contractors can be obtained from the
response received from contractors, open tender advertisements, pre-qualification
bids, Expression of Interest (EoI), against various enquiries on the website, dedicated
websites, exhibitions, buyer-seller meets, various publications of BIS, trade journals,
and so on. The e-procurement portal does pre-registration of contractors online. Such
data can be a source of information on prospective contractors;

iii)

New contractor(s) may be considered for enlistment at any time, provided they fulfil all
the required conditions. For any larger scale or critical enlistment of contractors,
Procuring Entity should call for EOI by publicising its need for development of sources.
The stages to be followed together with the applicable guidelines for EOI have been
detailed in Chapter 3;

iv)

While registering the firms, an undertaking may be obtained from them that they will
abide by the CIPP enclosed with the application with a clear warning that, in case of
transgression of the code of integrity, their names are likely to be deleted from the list

116

of enlisted contractors, besides any other penalty or more severe action as deemed fit;
and

v)

Along with the new/ renewal application for enlistment, the contractors should also be
asked to declare that, if awarded a contract in any LTE in which they participate, they
bind themselves to abide by the Procuring Entity’s General Conditions of Contract
(GCC). Such GCC should be part of the application.

vi)

Eligibility
i) Any firm, situated in India or abroad, which is in the business of providing
goods/ works/ services of specified categories of interest, shall be eligible for
enlistment;
ii) Contractors should possess valid Digital Signature Certificate (DSCs) Class III
b with the company name at the time of enlistment/ renewal, so as to enable them
to participate in e-procurements
iii) Firm, against whom punitive action has been taken, shall not be eligible for reenlistment during the currency of punitive action. Enlistment requests may not be
entertained from such firms, stakeholders of whom have any interest in de-Enlisted/
banned firms;

vii)

The application form, complete in all respects and accompanied with the requisite
processing fee and prescribed documents shall be submitted by the firms to the
registering authority. The enlistment application form, duly filled-in, when received from
the firms shall be scrutinised carefully for assessing the capacity and capability of the
firms including credentials, capability, quality control system, past performance,
financial background, and so on, of the applicant. References shall be made to other
firms of standing of whom the applicant firm claims to be a contractor. Likewise, the
applicant firm’s bankers may also be requested to advice about the financial standing
of the firm. Enlistment of contractors should be done with the approval of CA.

viii)

In cases where the firm is not considered capable and enlistment cannot be granted,
the concerned authority shall communicate the deficiencies and shortcomings direct to
the firms under intimation to the appellate authority. Where a request for re- verification
and review is made by the firm, along with any fee as prescribed and within the period
prescribed by the department, review shall be undertaken. Requests for re-verification
after expiry of the said period would be treated as a fresh application and processing
fee, if any prescribed, charged accordingly;

ix)

Enlistment should be for specific category of works;

x)

It should be mentioned in the letter of enlistment that the enlistment is valid for a period
of three years and would be considered for extension based (on application by the
contractor/ service provider) on satisfactory performance of the firm. However, the
enlistment would be initially treated as provisional and it would be treated as confirmed
only after the firm has satisfactorily executed one contract of the relevant category and
value from Procuring Entity. The extension of validity of enlistment is not a matter of
right and Procuring Entity reserves the right not to extend such enlistment without
assigning any reason;

117

xi)

All Enlisted contractors should be allocated a unique enlistment number. Once the
firms are enlisted, a circular shall be issued by the enlistment authority indicating the
names and addresses of the enlisted contractors with details of the requirements and
monetary value they will execute as well as the validity period, and so on, for which
they are enlisted;

xii)

Performance and conduct of every enlisted contractor is to be watched by the
concerned department. Procuring Entity should also reserve the right to remove firms
who do not perform satisfactorily, even during the validity of enlistment (after giving
due opportunity to the contractor to make a representation) if they fail to abide by the
terms and conditions of the enlistment or fail to execute contracts on time or do
substandard work or make any false declaration to any government agency or for any
ground which, in the opinion of the government, is not in public interest;

xiii)

Procuring Entity shall retain its option to reassess firms already enlisted, at any later
date, to satisfy itself about the current financial soundness/ credit worthiness, facilities
available, and so on. Thereafter, Procuring Entity may decide to retain them as enlisted
contractors for the requirements and monetary limit earlier considered or with
necessary changes as deemed fit. In case of adverse reports from the team of
Procuring Entity officers who reassess the firm, Procuring Entity shall delete such firm
from the enlisted contractors list;

7.5

Debarment

7.5.1

Rule 151 of GFR, 2017 deals with debarment which is as under:

i)

A bidder shall be debarred if he has been convicted of an offence
a)

under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988; or

b)

the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time being in force, for causing
any loss of life or property or causing a threat to public health as part of
execution of a public procurement contract.

ii)

A bidder debarred under sub-section (i) or any successor of the bidder shall not be
eligible to participate in a procurement process of any procuring entity for a period not
exceeding three years commencing from the date of debarment. Department of
Commerce (DGS&D) will maintain such list which will also be displayed on the website
of DGS&D as well as Central Public Procurement Portal.

iii)

A procuring entity may debar a bidder or any of its successors, from participating in any
procurement process undertaken by it, for a period not exceeding two years, if it
determines that the bidder has breached the code of integrity. The Ministry/ Department
will maintain such list which will also be displayed on their website.

iv)

The bidder shall not be debarred unless such bidder has been given a reasonable
opportunity to represent against such debarment.

7.5.2

Guidelines on Debarment of firms from Bidding52

1.

The guidelines are classified under following two types:-

52

Notified vide OM No. F.1/20/2018-PPD issued by Department of Expenditure dated 02.11.2021

118

i.

In cases where debarment is proposed to be limited to a single Ministry, the
appropriate Orders can be issued by that Ministry itself, thereby banning all its
business dealing with the debarred firm.
ii.
Where it is proposed to extend the debarment beyond the jurisdiction of the particular
Ministry i.e. covering to all central Ministries/ Departments, the requisite Orders shall
be issued by Department of Expenditure (DoE), Ministry of Finance (MoF).
Definitions
i.

Firm: The term 'firm' or 'bidder" has the same meaning for the purpose of these
Guidelines, which includes an individual or person, a company, a cooperative society,
a Hindu undivided family and an association or body of persons, whether incorporated
or not, engaged in trade or business.
ii.
Allied firm: All concerns which come within the sphere of effective influence of the
debarred firms shall be treated as allied firms. In determining this, the following factors
may be taken into consideration:
a) Whether the management is common;
b) Majority interest in the management is held by the partners or directors of
banned/ suspended firm;
c) Substantial or majority shares are owned by the banned/ suspended firm and
by virtue of this it has a controlling voice.
d) Directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by or is under common control
with another bidder.
e) All successor firms will also be considered as allied firms.
The terms “banning of firm”, ‘suspension’, ‘Black-Listing’ etc. convey the same meaning as of
“Debarment".
2.

Debarment by a Single Ministry/ Department

Orders for Debarment of a firm(s) shall be passed by a Ministry/ Department/organizations,
keeping in view of the following:
i.
ii.

iii.

iv.

v.

vi.

A bidder or any of its successors may be debarred from participating in any
procurement process for a period not exceeding two years.
Firms will be debarred if it is determined that the bidder has breached the code of
integrity as per Rule 175 of GFRs 2017. (Refer to para 7.2 of this Manual for further
reading on Code of Integrity).
A bidder can also be debarred for any actions or omissions by the bidder other than
violation of code of integrity, which in the opinion of the Ministry/Department, warrants
debarment, for the reasons like supply of sub-standard material, non-supply of
material, abandonment of works, sub-standard quality of works, failure to abide “Bid
Securing Declaration” etc.
It shall not be circulated to other Ministries/ Departments. It will only be applicable to
all the attached/ subordinate offices, Autonomous bodies, Central Public Sector
Undertakings (CPSUs) etc. of the Ministry/ Department issuing the debarment Order.
The concerned Ministry/ Department before issuing the debarment order against a firm
must ensure that reasonable opportunity has been given to the concerned firm to
represent against such debarment (including personal hearing, if requested by firm).
Secretary of Ministry/Department may nominate an officer at the rank of Joint
Secretary/Additional Secretary as competent authority to debar the firms.

119

vii.

Ministry/ Department that issued the order of debarment can also issue an Order for
revocation of debarment before the period of debarment is over, if there is adequate
justification for the same. Ordinarily, the revocation of the Order before expiry of
debarred period should be done with the approval of Secretary concerned of
Ministry/Department.
viii.
The Ministry/Department will maintain list of debarred firms, which will also be
displayed on its website.
ix.
Debarment is an executive function and should not be allocated to Vigilance
Department.
3.
It is possible that the firm may be debarred concurrently by more than one Ministry/
Department. Ministries/ Departments at their option may also delegate powers to debar
bidders to their CPSUs, Attached Offices/ Autonomous Bodies etc. In such cases, broad
principles for debarment in para 2 as above are to be kept in mind. Debarment by such bodies
like CPSUs etc. shall be applicable only for the procurements made by such bodies. Similarly,
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) can also debar bidders up to two years on its portal. In
case of debarments done by CPSUs, revocation of the debarment orders before expiry of
debarred period should be done only with the approval of Chief Executive Officer of concerned
CPSUs etc.
4.

Debarment across All Ministries/ Departments

vi.
5.

Where a Ministry/ Department is of the view that business dealings with a particular
firm should be banned across all the Ministries/ Departments by debarring the firm
from taking part in any bidding procedure floated by the Central Government Ministries/
Departments, the Ministry/ Department concerned, should after obtaining the approval
of the Secretary concerned, forward to DoE a self-contained note setting out all the
facts of the case and the justification for the proposed debarment, along with all the
relevant papers and documents. DoE will issue the necessary orders after satisfying
itself that proposed debarment across all the Ministries/ Departments is in accordance
with Rule 151 of GFRs, 2017. This scrutiny is intended to ensure uniformity of
treatment in all cases.
The firm will remain in suspension mode (i.e. debarred) during the interim period till
the final decision taken by DoE, only in the Ministry/ Department forwarding such
proposal.
Ministry/ Department before forwarding the proposal to DoE must ensure that
reasonable opportunity has been given to the concerned firm to represent against such
debarment (including personal hearing, if requested by firm). If DoE realizes that
sufficient opportunity has not be given to the firm to represent against the debarment,
such debarment requests received from Ministries/ Departments shall be rejected.
DoE can also give additional opportunity, at their option, to firm to represent against
proposed debarment. DoE can also take suo-moto action to debar the firms in certain
circumstances.
No contract of any kind whatsoever shall be placed on the debarred firm, including its
allied firms by any Ministries/ Departments/ Attached/Subordinate offices of the
Government of India including autonomous body, CPSUs etc. after the issue of a
debarment order.
DoE will maintain list of such debarred firms, which will be displayed on Central Public
Procurement Portal.

7.6

An order for debarment passed shall be deemed to have been automatically revoked
on the expiry of that specified period and it will not be necessary to issue a specific
formal order of revocation.
A debarment order may be revoked before the expiry of the Order, by the competent
authority, if it is of the opinion that the disability already suffered is adequate in the
circumstances of the case or for any other reason.
Other Provisions (common to both types of debarment)
No contract of any kind whatsoever shall be placed to debarred firm including its allied
firms after the issue of a debarment order by the Ministry/ Department. Bids from only
such firms shall be considered for placement of contract, which are neither debarred
on the date of opening of tender (first bid, normally called as technical bid, in case of
two packet/two stage bidding) nor debarred on the date of contract. Even in the cases
of risk purchase, no contract should be placed on such debarred firms.
If case, any debar firms has submitted the bid, the same will be ignored. In case such
firm is lowest (L-1), next lowest firm shall be considered as L-1. Bid security submitted
by such debarred firms shall be returned to them.
Contracts concluded before the issue of the debarment order shall, not be affected by
the debarment Orders.
The Debarment shall be automatically extended to all its allied firms. In case of joint
venture/ consortium is debarred all partners will also stand debarred for the period
specified in Debarment Order. The names of partners should be clearly specified in
the “Debarment Order”.
Debarment in any manner does not impact any other contractual or other legal rights
of the procuring entities.
The period of debarment shall start from the date of issue of debarment order.
The Order of debarment will indicate the reason(s) in brief that lead to debarment of
the firm.
Ordinarily, the period of debarment should not be less than six months.
In case of shortage of suppliers in a particular group, such debarments may also hurt
the interest of procuring entities. In such cases, endeavour should be to pragmatically
analyze the circumstances, try to reform the supplier and may get a written
commitment from the supplier that its performance will improve.
All Ministries/ Departments must align their existing Debarment Guidelines in
conformity with these Guidelines. Further, bidding documents must also be suitably
amended, if required.

Project Management

7.6.A Poor management of public funded projects costs the nation in terms of the following,
be it in the owner organization or in construction firms contracted to build a project:

i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v)

Additional expenditure burden due to increased costs, crowding out more deserving
schemes and projects
Affect viability of projects due to increase in construction, causing losses to CPSE or
agency concerned
Economic burden, due to delayed return in investments
Imposes unnecessary economic burden on affected stakeholders
Creates a culture of acceptance of delay and avoidable costs – breeding more cases

121

vi)

Increased costs of procurement due to monetization of higher risks, perceived by
contractors, of delays and scope creep associated with public funded projects.
7.6.B Given the importance of project management in the final outcomes of projects, owner
organizations which plan, fund and implement projects as well as construction firms contracted
to build and/or manage projects need to adopt ad institutionalize project management
standards in their processes. A number of International Project Management Standards have
been evolved by Governments as well as International bodies to assist organizations minimize
cost and time overruns. While there are a variety of frameworks such as ISO-21500, PMBOK,
PRINCE2, LOGFRAME, etc., most of them have a lot in common and have the following
elements that need to be taken into account for effective management of projects. Some of
these standards may be adopted by Government to improve processes and train project staff.
7.6.C The quality of project works significantly depends on supervision and monitoring. For
completion of the projects within the stipulated time and cost and with specified quality
standards, periodical review should be done by various levels of the officers.
7.6.D Information Technology (IT) enabled project management systems can help in
improving efficiency, transparency and aid faster decision making in execution of projects.
These systems may be used for maintenance of records for the progress of work (including
hindrance register), variations, etc., wherein reasons for delays are also to be captured on real
time basis. Such systems may be used for capturing progress and quality of work, site
records/ photographs/ videos etc. including geo tagging.
7.6.E Wherever applicable, the role of the Project Management Consultant (PMC) should be
clearly defined in the contracts. Deployment of the PMC does not absolve the project
executing authority of the responsibility to supervise the quality and timelines of the project.
7.6.F The credentials and deployment schedule of key and other technical personnel to be
engaged by PMC on the work should be taken along with the bid. During execution, adherence
to deployment of key and other technical personnel as per the schedule of deployment should
be ensured.
7.6.G Execution of the work shall primarily be the responsibility of the officials designed with
such responsibility. However, for large contracts senior officers shall also review the progress
and quality of the work at various stages of construction. To this effect, presentations on the
project performance may be made periodically before the senior officers depending upon the
value of the project and progress of the project vis-à-vis schedule. Project executing
authorities should put in place detailed instructions in this regard.
Note: In para 7.6.G instructions containing “shall” are mandatory; any deviation from these
instructions shall require relaxation from Ministry of Finance (for Ministries/ Departments etc.)
or from the Board of Directors (for Central Public Sector Enterprises).
7.6.H Project executing authorities should put in place a system for capturing the
photographs and videos of important and critical activities of construction. This may be
implemented in projects above a threshold value or, if possible, in all projects. Such photos/
videos may be uploaded in IT based project monitoring system to facilitate monitoring the
progress and quality of work as well as assessment of delay in execution of work by
stakeholders and senior management. Apart from this photographs and videos may serve as
permanent record of the project for posterity in case needed for any eventuality including
litigation or enquiry/ investigation.

122

7.6.I It may also be useful to stipulate organizational standards and/or certifications for
project managers/staff, in complex projects, as tender conditions to minimize risk of cost and
time overruns:
7.6.1

Organisational Standards: ISOs 21500:201253

Guidance on Project Management is an international standard developed by the International
Organization for Standardization, or ISO starting in 2007 and released in 2012. It was intended
to provide generic guidance, explain core principles and what constitutes good practice in
project management. ISO 21500 was developed to offer guidance on the concepts and
processes of project management with the goal of implementing processes and best practices
to improve project management performance. While, the standard describes important
concepts and processes of project management it does not provide detailed guidance and
general management topics are limited to relevant aspects of project management. The
standard as developed by the ISO was modelled on the PMIs PMBOK, although there are
some key differences. The ISO project management standard is only 47 pages long and is
limited to the introduction of the processes, their inputs, and their outputs. Another major
change is the introduction of a new subject by ISO, namely, “stakeholder management”. The
ISO 21500 can be used as a basis for the development of national standards. It is not intended
for certification or regulatory purposes.
7.6.2

Organisational Standards: IS 15188:2009

The Indian Standard, on Construction Project Management, covers general guidelines for
construction project management. The scope of this standard covers the stages subsequent
to the stage of approval (when a decision to implement the project including its financing is
taken) till commissioning and handing over of the project. The standard explains that the
distinct features of a construction project include the temporary nature of the organizations
involved, the evolutionary process of project deliverables during project development stages
and the unique output of the built facility. This standard is intended to provide a general
overview of construction project management and information regarding the applicable tools
and techniques. It covers general provisions about project, stakeholder, construction project
life cycle, construction project delivery models, construction methodologies/techniques and
organizational structures. It covers the construction project management stages such as pre
construction, construction and commissioning and handling over and gives guidelines under
these stages and their sub-stages for management of construction projects. It gives brief
guidelines on the following construction project management functions:
i)
Scope management,
ii)
Procurement management,
iii)
Time management,
iv)
Cost management,
v)
Quality management,
vi)
Risk management,
vii)
Communication management,
viii)
Human resources management,
ix)
Health, safety and environment management,
x)
Integration management, and
xi)
Sustainability management.

123

9 out of 12 parts (except the ones in italics) of the above standard have been issued.
7.6.3 Project Staff certification
Project Management Institute (PMI-USA) has developed certification standards for project
managers and executives in a variety of areas such as general project management, risk
management, scheduling, etc. The PMI Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK)
describes processes, inputs, outputs and associated tools and techniques. Both organizations
use the concept of process as an integral part of project management. A large number of
project firms have adopted this standard for improving competence of their manpower. ISO
and PMI segregate project processes into five process groups with some minor variances in
labelling. The differences between the two standards are minimal with respect to process
groups and subjects/knowledge areas. The substantive difference in the two standards is with
the detail and description of tools and techniques, because ISO 21500:2012 do not provide it.
The 47 project management processes identified in the PMBOK® Guide are further grouped
into ten separate Knowledge Areas. Knowledge Area represents a complete set of concepts,
terms, and activities that make up a professional field, project management field, or area of
specialization. These ten Knowledge Areas are used on most projects most of the time. Project
teams should utilize these ten Knowledge Areas and other Knowledge Areas, as appropriate,
for their specific project. The Knowledge Areas are:
i)
Project Integration Management
ii)
Project Scope Management
iii)
Project Time Management
iv)
Project Cost Management
v)
Project Quality Management
vi)
Project Human Resource Management
vii)
Project Communications Management
viii)

7.6.4 Capacity of Contractors
Contractors involved in construction or development of large projects for the Government
needs to have tremendous capacity to deliver projects on time and cost. Firms are often
unable to deliver contracts on time in cases where conditions precedent is met by the
Government agency. There are several other reasons for project delays or escalation of costs:
i)
Poor Governance within the firm
ii)
Financial mismanagement
iii)
Incompetent project leadership
iv)
Lack of competence in the project team
v)
Inability to use technology for project management.
vi)
Poor process management and standardisation

125

Financial management by the contractor is an equally critical factor. Mobilising finances and
resources for several large projects on which the firm is working on poses significant
managerial challenge. Hence, ensuring that the eligibility criteria in fixing the minimum
turnover, net worth, profits and bidding capacity in relation the project size (simultaneous
exposure in other large projects) becomes a sine qua non for successful execution of projects.
There is need to ensure that contracting firms adopt appropriate management standards.
Adoption of ISO 21500:2012could be specified in the RFQ conditions when inviting tenders.
Third party assessment of the capabilities listed in this standard could be called for.
Contracting firms involved project construction need qualified, trained personnel and
managers to plan and construct projects in time, cost and quality. It is important to ensure that
contractor organisations have qualified/ certified project management professionals at the time
of commencement of works on awarded contracts. Certifications such as PMI-PMP/PRINCE2practitioner/CPMP etc., besides experience, may be specified in the contract conditions for
the key staff of the field project organisation of the contractor.

Capacity of Government Organisations
Selecting and appointing a full-time competent and experienced Project
Director/Mission Director to head the project, especially large projects, on part of the
public organisation is a crucial decision. Public agencies need to appoint a Project
Director in time to prevent drift and cost/time overruns. This must be the first decision
in commencement of projects.
Recruiting and staffing the public sector organisation with experienced and reliable
heads of finance, technical, legal, HR & PR wings will ensure effective decision making
on project options, resolving project hurdles, supervision of the Project Consultants,
completing procurement processes and awarding contracts on time, launching
construction/implementation, monitoring construction, contract and claims
management, monitoring quality, cost control, managing stakeholders, etc., are crucial
activities that only the owner organisation would care about.
The quality, experience and competence of the Project Design and Management
Consultant selected to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) is a key decision.
Experience and performance of the PMC in past projects are vital in determining
optimal decision making in project design. Time spent in site and market investigation,
exploring and evaluating technology options, finance and implementation options,
evaluating procurement options, etc., would save a lot of costs and time later.
Involvement of the project organisation in the DPR preparation is a key factor in project
success. Dilution of eligibility criteria in selection of consultants could save money in
the short run, but end up very expensive in the long run, especially in large projects.
Delay in land acquisition and securing all statutory clearances for the projects are
critical conditions precedent for start of any project. As a principle, no project contracts
may be awarded without possession of at least 90% of the entire land and the obtaining
statutory clearances/NOCs for project construction and operation.
Weekly Project Management meetings of owner organisation with the PMC/IE and
contractors are key factors in ensuring effective communications, timely detection of
critical issues and their resolution. This will also enable detection and removal of
hurdles, prevention of disputes or at least satisfactory resolution of disputes within the
ambit of the contract.
The Project Management team in the Government agency has to regularly and
independently track the status of the projects; identify bottlenecks and risks that may

126

vii)

7.6.6

impact project delivery. Developing a risk management strategy enables identification
of risks associated with the projects enabling timely decision making by the relevant
authorities. A risk management group may need to be setup to periodically assess
risks and review mitigation measures undertaken.
Delay in taking timely decisions : Delay in decision making by the officials of the
project executing authority on various changes in the project scheme arising out of
emerging situations during execution of the work is also one of the contributors to the
delay in completion of projects. Sometimes timely decisions on these changes are so
crucial that the next step could only be taken after addressing the change. Delay in
decisions by the project executing authority can also lead to litigation due to inadequate
utilisation/idling of resources of the contractor. There is frequently a feeling among
officials that indecision is safe while a decision may lead to adverse consequences for
the decision maker. Therefore, there is a need for project executing authorities to put
in place a system of resolution of the issues coupled with timelines for various levels
to take decisions.
Project executing authorities may review the flow chart of decision making and remove
redundancies for faster decision making. They may also fix timelines for taking
decisions on variations, extra items and changes in scope and specifications, etc to
avoid delay and litigation arising out of delayed decisions.
Structuring contracts for timely completion

i)

Optimal sharing of risks has been a balanced way of ensuring that the time and
costs of completion of a project do not go way off the mark. Structuring contract
clauses keeping in mind the principle of ‘responsibility for each risk shall be with the
party best equipped to handle it’ has enabled contracts to lead to lower risk
perception
by bidders and as a result offer better prices. Contract clauses need
to
be
further
screened using this principle.
ii)
Scope & Design creep are widely stated causes for project delays. Changes in
scope or design midway or at start cause time and cost variations. It may be
therefore essential to consider options thoroughly and spend time on designs
exhaustively at the time of DPR preparation and before procurement.
iii)
Timely release of payments to contractors raises the confidence level of contractors
to mobilise more resources for early completion. DMRC’s practice of releasing 80% of the
Interim Payment Certificates (Bills) within 14 days of
claim by contractor and the rest
within 28 days of certification by the Engineer.
Building these payment clauses into
contracts raises contractor confidence,
reduces project risk perception and enables
better prices.
iv)
Embedding a fair price variation clause in contracts that mimics the market
forces of escalation/reduction would lower risks to contractors and to the public
organisation as well. PV clauses would vary from contract to contract,
depending
the structure of materials and costs.
v)
Dispute Resolution Board (DRB) may be created by express consent of the
procuring entity and the contractor to monitor the project execution at various
stages of completion. This is a conciliation forum to resolve disputes amicably. The
primary function of DRBs is to monitor the progress of the project with
respect to contract
requirements. In case of any non-compliance with respect to the contract, the Board

127

immediately interferes and suggests ways to resolve
the dispute. DRB mechanism may
be embedded in contracts.
vi)
Encourage institutional arbitration: Settlement of disputes through Institutional
arbitration is better than ad-hoc arbitration. Institutional arbitration provides an
established format with a proven record ensures impartial decision-making and
adherence to pre-established rules and procedures.
7.6.7 Aligning the Interest of The Stakeholders
i)
The incentive structure for all the key stakeholders of public procurement ought to be
such that the system itself will ensure timely delivery of the projects / works in a
qualitative manner within approved cost. A balanced framework and work culture,
where risk and rewards are properly shared amongst stakeholders and timely
completion of quality projects is the common goal, can be the bedrock of efficient
project management. An incentive structure, which may include pecuniary as well as
non-pecuniary aspects (Including public recognition), linked with measurable
parameters of outcome / output, can help align the interests of stakeholders. An ethics
based regime, where integrity of all the stakeholders is nurtured, can help increase
efficiency in all aspects of project management.
ii)
Public authorities may devise strategies to provide incentives to contractors
/concessionaires/ consultants/ architects/ other stakeholders by various means,
including bonus, better rating and recognition for early/ timely / quality completion of
the projects. Similar strategies may be devised for recognition of engineers/ officers/
other team members for early / timely and quality completion of the projects. The
practice of mentioning the names of the contractor and the project in charge publicly
at work sites may be implemented. Such recognition may be in a form which has long
shelf life so as to associate the contractor and project In-charge with the life of the
project.
iii)
“Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is
success”. It is an accepted fact that the success of any project is dependent on a wellcoordinated team working towards a common goal. For successful execution of any
project within specified time, cost and quality, the interest of all the stakeholders need
to be aligned. Coordinated efforts of all stakeholders such as contractors, consultants,
public authority and project executing authority and public representatives will bring
about the best possible outcome.

The formula for price variation will thus be:!"

$"

'𝐹 + 𝑎 *!# + + 𝑏 *$#+𝑃𝑎 = 𝑃𝑜 &
0 − 𝑃𝑜
100
Where: Pa is then adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus figure will indicate a reduction
in the contract price) on the date of supply.
Po is the contract price on the base date (which is taken as the date on which tender is due to
open).
F is the fixed element (as the percentage of the total price) not subject to price variation.
a is the assigned percentage to the material element in the contract price.
b is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the contract price.
(F, a and b being percentages should total 100)
Lo and L1 are the average wage indices for the quarter before the quarter in which base month
falls and for the quarter before the quarter in which date of supply falls; respectively. For
example for a tender opening on March 17, 2016 (base date), Lo would be average wage index
for the quarter of Oct-Dec 2015.
Mo and M1 are the material prices/indices as average of the month, two month prior to the
month in which base month falls and average of the month, two month prior to the month in
which date of supply falls, respectively. For example, for a tender opening on March 17, 2016
(base date), Mo would be prices/index as average of the month of January 2016. All material
prices/indices will be basic prices without excise duty and without any other central, state,
local taxes and duties and Octroi.
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element can be broken up into
two or three components such as Mx, My, Mz.
The following conditions would be applicable to price adjustment:
•

Base dates shall be due dates of opening of bids (technical bid in two or three
envelop/cover system).

•

Date of supply shall be the date of calculation/determination of the price variation.

•

No price increase is allowed beyond original delivery period.

157

•

No price adjustment shall be payable on the portion of contract price paid to the seller as
an advance/interim payment after the date of such payment.

•

Total adjustment will be subject to maximum ceiling of ____%.

•

No price adjustment shall be payable if this is less than or equal to 2% (two percent) of
Po.

•

Payments for each supply would initially be made as per the base price mentioned in the
contract. Price adjustment bill should be submitted only quarterly for the supplies made
during the quarter.

•

In GTE tenders extra care should be taken in selecting the price indices. Preferably the
price indices should be from the same country and of same currency as the country and
currency of the bidder. In case price is in a currency of a country where inflation is low and
!"

$"

the indices are from country with much higher inflation rates, *!#+ and *$#+ should be
%#

multiplied by a correction factor of exchange rates*%"+, where E0 is the exchange rate of
country of M and L indices with reference to currency of price P. For example, if M&L are
from India and P is in $, then Eo is Number of Rs. in a $ on base date and E1 is the
exchange rate on determination date.
•

Even if there is no price adjustment claim, supplier must submit all relevant data to prove
that there is no downward variation. In any case he must submit a declaration as follows;

“It is certified that there has been no decrease in the price of price variation indices
and in the event of any decrease of such indices during the currency of this contract we shall
promptly notify the same to the purchaser and offer requisite reduction in the contract rate.”

Appendix 1: Advanced Concepts of Value for Money and
Fundamental Principles of Public Procurement
1.0

The Concept of Value

Value is a management and economics concept. It represents the extent of satiation of a
hierarchy of needs of a person by a product bought for this purpose. This is subjective and
difficult to quantify. This is because different persons (or the same persons under different
circumstances) would have different hierarchy of needs and would perceive different extents
of satiation or value from the same product. There are three sources of the value of a product.
The first source of value is from the functional usage of the product (known as use value) and
the second source comes from the social status associated with the ownership of the product
(esteem value). This can be shown as the difference between a luxury branded gold-plated,
diamond encrusted pen and a disposable non-descript functional pen, though both fulfil the
broadly same function and have the same use value. The luxury branded pen, in addition to
the use value, also has additional esteem value. The third source of value comes from the
price that one can get by exchanging or scrapping the product at the end of the useful life of
the product. This is called the disposal value. Normally, when people buy a car, they do
consider the estimated disposal value of different choices of models. Value is the sum total of
all the three values.

2.0

Total Cost of Ownership

While the value of a product covers all components of value over the “Whole-Of-Life” (WOL),
the costs incurred on the product should also take into consideration the total of various
elements of costs incurred over WOL of the product. For this purpose, future costs are
discounted to present value (not to be confused with the value we are discussing – this is a
financial discounting concept). For example, it would not be prudent to buy a cheap car, which
has a very high cost of operating. This is called variously as WOL or “Life-Cycle-Cost” (LCC)
or “Total Cost of Ownership” (TCO). The last is a preferred nomenclature in procurement and
is defined as the total of all costs associated with a product, service, or capital equipment that
are incurred over its expected life. Typically, these costs can be broken into four broad
categories:

i)

Procurement price. The amount paid to the vendor/ contractor for the product, service,
or capital equipment;

ii) Acquisition costs. All costs associated with bringing the product, service, or capital
equipment into operation at the customer's location. Examples of acquisition costs are
sourcing, administration, freight, taxes, and so on;

iii) Usage costs. In the case of a product, all costs associated with converting the procured
part/ material into the finished product and supporting it through its usable life. In the case
of a service, all costs associated with the performance of the service that is not included
in the procurement price. In the case of capital equipment, all costs associated with
operating the equipment through its life. Examples of usage costs are inventory,
conversion, wastage, lost productivity, lost sales, warranty, installation, training,
downtime, and so on; and

159

iv) End-of-life costs. All costs incurred when a product, service, or capital equipment
reaches the end of its usable life, net of amounts received from the sale of the remaining
product or the equipment (disposal value) as the case may be. Examples of end-of-life
costs are obsolescence, disposal, clean-up, and project termination costs

3.0

Value for Money

Besides value of a product or service, the customer also has his own notion of “value” of a
particular sum of money. This is different for different people or even for the same person in
different circumstances. When the perceived value of a product matches the perceived value
of the amount of money (cost of the product), the customer feels he got the full value for his
money. This is called the VfM. In procurement, Total Cost of Ownership is taken to evaluate
value for money. Given the limited resources available to the government, ensuring VfM in
procurement is the key to ensuring the optimum utilisation of scarce budgetary resources. It
usually means buying the product or service with the lowest WOL costs that is ‘fit for purpose’
and just meets the specification. VfM also incorporates affordability; clearly, goods or services
that are unaffordable cannot be bought. This should be addressed as soon as possible within
the process, ideally at the need assessment stage before procurement commences. In order
to address this issue, a change in the procurement approach, specification or business
strategy may be required.
Where an alternative is chosen that does not have the lowest WOL costs, then the additional
‘value added’ benefit must be proportional and objectively justifiable. Assessment of bids
should be conducted only in relation to a published set of evaluation criteria (which should be
relevant to the subject of the contract), and any ‘added value’ that justifies a higher price must
flow from these defined criteria. In public procurement VfM is often primarily established
through the competitive process. A strong competition from a vibrant market will generally
deliver a VfM outcome. However, where competition is limited, or even absent, other routes
may have to be used to establish VfM. These can include benchmarking, construction of
theoretical cost models or ‘shadow’ bids by the procurement agency. For major contracts, this
can require considerable financial expertise and external support. A VfM assessment, based
on the published conditions for participation and evaluation, may include consideration of
some factors such as:
i)

Fitness for purpose;

ii) Potential vendor/ contractor’s experience and performance history;
iii) Flexibility (including innovation and adaptability over the lifecycle of the procurement);
iv) Environmental sustainability (such as energy efficiency and environmental impact); and
v) Total cost of ownership
But due to uncertainties in estimates of various components of TCO (and actual costs over
the life-cycle) and intangibles of Value, some element of subjectivity may become
unavoidable, and hence is not normally useable in routine Public Procurement cases.
Therefore preference is given to alternative means for ensuring VfM by way of optimal
description of needs; development of value-engineered specifications/ Terms of Reference
and appropriate packaging/ slicing of requirements and selection of appropriate mode/ bidding
systems of procurement etc.

Fundamental Principles of Public Procurement
160

General Financial Rules, 2017 lay down the Fundamental Principles of Public Procurement.
These principles and other additional obligations of procuring authorities in public procurement
can be organised into five fundamental principles of public procurement, which all procuring
authorities must abide by and be accountable for:

i)

Transparency Principle

All procuring authorities are responsible and accountable to ensure transparency, fairness,
equality, competition and appeal rights. This involves simultaneous, symmetric and
unrestricted dissemination of information to all likely bidders, sufficient for them to know and
understand the availability of bidding opportunities and actual means, processes and timelimits prescribed for completion of enlistment of bidders, bidding, evaluation, grievance
redressal, award and management of contracts. It implies that such officers must ensure that
there is consistency (absence of subjectivity), predictability (absence of arbitrariness), clarity,
openness (absence of secretiveness), equal opportunities (absence of discrimination) in
processes. In essence Transparency Principle also enjoins upon the Procuring Authorities to
do only that which it had professed to do as pre-declared in the relevant published documents
and not to do anything that had not been so declared. As part of this principle, all procuring
entities should ensure that offers should be invited following a fair and transparent procedure
and also ensure publication of all relevant information on the Central Public Procurement
Portal (CPPP).

ii)

Professionalism Principle

As per these synergic attributes, the procuring authorities have a responsibility and
accountability to ensure professionalism, economy, efficiency, effectiveness and integrity in
the procurement process. They must avoid wasteful, dilatory and improper practices violating
the Code of integrity for Public Procurement (CIPP) mentioned in Chapter 3 of this manual.
They should, at the same time, ensure that the methodology adopted for procurement should
not only be reasonable and appropriate for the cost and complexity but should also effectively
achieve the planned objective of the procurement. As part of this principle, the government
may prescribe professional standards and specify suitable training and certification
requirements for officials dealing with procurement matters.
In reference to the above two principles - Transparency and Professionalism Principle, It may
be useful to refer to the following provisions in the General Financial Rules, 2017:
“Rule 144. Fundamental principles of public buying: Fundamental principles of public buying.
(for all procurements including procurement of works).— Every authority delegated with the
financial powers of procuring goods in public interest shall have the responsibility and
accountability to bring efficiency, economy, and transparency in matters relating to public
procurement and for fair and equitable treatment of suppliers and promotion of competition in
public procurement.
The procedure to be followed in making public procurement must conform to the following
yardsticks:a)
The description of the subject matter of procurement to the extent
practicable should -1)
be objective, functional, generic and measurable and specify
technical, qualitative and performance characteristics;

161

2)
not indicate a requirement for a particular trade mark, trade
name or brand.
b)
The specifications in terms of quality, type etc., as also quantity of
goods to be procured, should be clearly spelt out keeping in view the specific
needs of the procuring organisations. The specifications so worked out should
meet the basic needs of the organisation without including superfluous and
non-essential features, which may result in unwarranted expenditure.
c)
Where applicable, the technical specifications shall, to the extent
practicable, be based on the national technical regulations or recognized
national standards or building codes, wherever such standards exist, and in
their absence, be based on the relevant international standards. In case of
Government of India funded projects abroad, the technical specifications may
be framed based on requirements and standards of the host beneficiary
Government, where such standards exist. Provided that a procuring entity may,
for reasons to be recorded in writing, adopt any other technical specification.
d)
Care should also be taken to avoid purchasing quantities in excess of
requirement to avoid inventory carrying costs;
e)
Offers should be invited following a fair, transparent and reasonable
procedure;
f)
The Procuring Entity should be satisfied that the selected offer
adequately meets the requirement in all respects;
g)
The Procuring Entity should satisfy itself that the price of the selected
offer is reasonable and consistent with the quality required;
h)
At each stage of procurement the concerned Procuring Entity must
place on record, in precise terms, the considerations which weighed with it
while taking the procurement decision.
i)
A complete schedule of procurement cycle from date of issuing the
tender to date of issuing the contract should be published when the tender is
issued.
j)
All Ministries/Departments shall prepare Annual Procurement Plan
before the commencement of the year and the same should also be placed on
the their website”
k)
[Notwithstanding anything contained in these Rules, Department of
Expenditure may, by order in writing, impose restrictions, including
prior registration and/or screening, on procurement from bidders from a
country or countries, or a class of countries, on grounds of defence of
India, or matters directly or indirectly related thereto including national
security; no procurement shall be made in violation of such
restrictions.]57

162

Over and above transparency and professionalism, the procuring authorities have also the
responsibility and accountability to conduct public procurement in a manner to facilitate
achievement of the broader objectives of the government - to the extent these are specifically
included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’:
(a) Preferential procurement from backward regions, weaker sections and Micro and
Small Enterprises (MSEs), locally manufactured goods or services, to the extent
specifically included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’; and
(b) Reservation of procurement of specified class of goods from or through certain
nominated CPSEs or Government Organisations, to the extent specifically included in
the ‘Procurement Guidelines’.
(c) Support to broader social policy and programme objectives of the government (for
example, economic growth, strengthening of local industry - make-in-India, Ease of
Doing Business, job and employment creation, and so on, to the extent specifically
included in the ‘Procurement Guidelines’);
(d) Facilitating administrative goals of other departments of government (for example,
ensuring tax or environmental compliance by participants, Energy Conservation,
accessibility for People With Disabilities etc. to the extent specifically included in the
‘Procurement Guidelines’).
(e) Procurement policies and procedures must comply with accessibility criteria which
may be mandated by the Government from time to time. Keeping this in view,
Department of Expenditure amended Rule 144 of GFR, 2017 and introduced a subpoint (xi) imposing restrictions under the rule [as mentioned under (ii) above]. The
detailed provisions were notified through Order (Public Procurement No.1)58 which are
as follows:

exclusionary qualificatory stage (i.e. the first stage at which the qualifications of
tenderers are evaluated and unqualified bidders are excluded) has not been
completed: No contracts shall be placed on bidders from such countries. Tenders
received from bidders from such countries shall be dealt with as if they are noncompliant with the tender conditions and the tender shall be processed accordingly.
b) If the tendering process has crossed the first exclusionary qualificatory stage, if the
qualified bidders include bidders from such countries, the entire process shall be

i.
An officer, not below the rank of Joint Secretary, designated for this purpose
by DPIIT, who shall be the Chairman;
ii.
Officers (ordinarily not below the rank of Joint Secretary) representing the
Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs, and of those Departments
whose sectors are covered by applications under consideration;
iii.
Any other officer whose presence is deemed necessary by the Chairman of the

c) DPIIT has laid down the method of application, format etc. for such bidders as stated
in para (1) (a) above60. On receipt of an application seeking registration from a bidder from
a country covered by para (1) (a) above the Competent Authority shall first seek political
and security clearances from the Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs,
as per guidelines issued from time to time. Registration shall not be given unless political
and security clearance have both been received.
d) The Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs may issue guidelines for
internal use regarding the procedure for scrutiny of such applications by them.
e) The decision of the Competent Authority, to register such bidder may be for all kinds
of tenders or for a specified type(s) of goods or services, and may be for a specified or
unspecified duration of time, as deemed fit. The decision of the Competent Authority shall
be final.
f) Registration shall not be granted unless the representatives of the Ministries of Home
Affairs and External Affairs on the Committee concur61.
g) Registration granted by the Competent Authority of the Government of India shall be
valid not only for procurement by Central Government and its agencies/ public enterprises
etc. but also for procurement by State Governments and their agencies/ public enterprises
etc. No fresh registration at the State level shall be required.
h) The Competent Authority is empowered to cancel the registration already granted if it
determines that there is sufficient cause. Such cancellation by itself, however, will not
affect the execution of contracts already awarded. Pending cancellation, it may also
59

(i)In respect of application of the Order to procurement by/ under State Governments, all functions assigned
to DPIIT shall be carried out by the State Government concerned through a specific department or authority
designated by it. The composition of the Registration Committee shall be as decided by the State Government
and paragraph G above shall not apply. However, the requirement of political and security clearance as per para
D shall remain and no registration shall be granted without such clearance.
(ii) Registration granted by State Governments shall be valid only for procurement by the State Government and
its agencies/ public enterprises etc. and shall not be valid for procurement in other states or by the Government
of India and their agencies/ public enterprises etc.

tenders during the period of suspension.
i) For national security reasons, the Competent Authority shall not be required to give
reasons for rejection/cancellation of registration of a bidder.
j) In transitional cases falling under para (2) above, where it is felt that it will not be
practicable to exclude bidders from a country which shares a land border with India, a
reference seeking permission to consider such bidders shall be made by the procuring
entity to the Competent Authority, giving full information and detailed reasons. The
Competent Authority shall decide whether such bidders may be considered, and if so shall
follow the procedure laid down in the above paras.
k) Periodic reports on the acceptance/ refusal of registration during the preceding period
may be required to be sent to the Cabinet Secretariat. Details will be issued separately in
due course by DPIIT.

Special Cases [In reference to para (1) (b) above]
a) Bona fide procurements made through GeM without knowing the country of the bidder
till the date fixed by GeM for this purpose, shall not be invalidated by the Order.
b) Bona fide small procurements, made without knowing the country of the bidder, shall
not be invalidated by the Order.
c) In projects which receive international funding with the approval of the Department of
Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, the procurement guidelines applicable to
the project shall normally be followed, notwithstanding anything contained in the Order
and without reference to the Competent Authority. Exceptions to this shall be decided
in consultation with DEA.
d) The Order shall not apply to procurement by Indian missions and by offices of
government agencies/ undertakings located outside India.
e) The Order will not apply to bidders from those countries (even if sharing a land border
with India) to which the Government of India has extended lines of credit or in which
the Government of India is engaged in development projects. Updated lists of countries
to which lines of credit have been extended or in which development projects are
undertaken are given in the website of the Ministry of External Affairs62.
f) A bidder is permitted to procure raw material, components, sub-assemblies etc. from
the vendors from countries which shares a land border with India. Such vendors will
not be required to be registered with the Competent Authority, as it is not regarded as
“sub-contracting”. However, in case a bidder has proposed to supply finished goods
procured directly/ indirectly from the vendors from the countries sharing land border
with India, such vendor will be required to be registered with the Competent Authority63.
g) Procurement of spare parts and other essential service support like Annual
Maintenance Contract (AMC)/ Comprehensive Maintenance Contract (CMC),
including consumables for closed systems, from Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs) or their authorized agents, shall be exempted from the requirement of
registration as mandated under Rule 144(xi) of GFR, 2017 and Public Procurement
orders issued in this regard64.

Clarification to Order (Public Procurement No.1) dated 23rd July 202065
a) For the purpose of (2)(b) above, “qualified bidders” means only those bidders would
otherwise have been qualified for award of the tender after considering all factors
including price, if the Order (Public Procurement No.1) dated 23rd July 2020 had not
been issued.
b) If bidders form such countries would not have qualified for award for reasons
unconnected with the said Orders (for example, because they do not meet tender
criteria or their price bid is higher or because of the provisions of purchase preference
under any other order or rule or any other reason) then there is no need to scrap the
tender/ start the process de novo.
c) The following examples are given to assist in implementation of the Order
i.
Example l: Four bids are received in a tender. One of them is from a country
which shares a land border with India. The bidder from such country is found
to be qualified technically by meeting all prescribed criteria and is also the
lowest bidder. In this case, the bidder is qualified for award of the tender, except
for the provisions of the Order (Public Procurement No. 1) dated 23rd July. In
this case, the tender should be scrapped and fresh tender initiated.
ii.
Example 2: The facts are as in Example 1, but the bidder from such country,
though technically qualified is not the lowest because there are other
technically qualified bidders whose price is lower. Hence the bidder from such
country would not be qualified for award of the tender irrespective of the Order
(Public Procurement No. 1) dated 23rd July 2020. In such a case, there is no
need to scrap the tender.
iii.
Example 3: The facts are as in Example 1, but the bidder from a country which
shares a land border with India, though technically qualified, is not eligible for
award due to the application of price preference as per other orders/ rules. In
such a case, there is no need to scrap the tender.
Example 4: Three bids are received in a tender. One of them is a bidder from a country sharing
a land border with India. The bidder from such a country does not meet the technical
requirements and hence is not qualified. There is no need to scrap the tender.
Extended Legal Responsibilities Principle

Procuring authorities must fulfil additional legal obligations in public procurement, over and
above mere conformity to the mercantile laws (which even private sector procurements have
to comply with). The Constitution of India has certain provisions regarding fundamental rights
and public procurement. Courts have, over a time, taking a broader view of Public
Procurement as a function of ‘State’, interpreted these to extend the responsibility and
accountability of public procurement Authorities. Courts in India thus exercise additional
judicial review (beyond contractual issues) over public procurement in relation to the manner
of decision making in respect of fundamental rights, fair play and legality. Similarly, procuring
authorities have also the responsibility and accountability to comply with the laws relating to
Governance Issues like Right to Information (RTI) Act and Prevention of Corruption Act, and
so on.

Public Accountability Principle

Notified through Order (Public Procurement No. 3) vide F.No.6/18/2019-PPD issued by
Department of Expenditure dated 24.07.2020
168

Procuring authorities are accountable for all the above principles to several statutory and
official bodies in the Country – the Legislature and its Committees, Central Vigilance
Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Central Bureau of Investigations and
so on– in addition to administrative accountability. As a result, each individual public
procurement transaction is liable to be scrutinised independently, in isolation, besides judging
the overall outcomes of procurement process over a period of time. Procuring authorities thus
have responsibility and accountability for compliance of rules and procedures in each
individual procurement transaction besides the achievement of overall procurement
outcomes. The Procuring Entity, at each stage of procurement, must therefore, place on
record, in precise terms, the considerations which weighed with it while making the
procurement decision from need assessment to fulfilment of need. Such records must be
preserved, retained in easily retrievable form and made available to such oversight agencies.
The procuring entity shall Therefore, maintain and retain audit trails, records and documents
generated or received during its procurement proceedings, in chronological order, the files will
be stored in an identified place and retrievable for scrutiny whenever needed without wastage
of time. The documents and record will include:
a)
documents pertaining to determination of need for procurement;
b) description of the subject matter of the procurement;
c) Statement of the justification for choice of a procurement method other than open
competitive bidding;
d) Documents relating to pre-qualification and enlistment of bidders, if applicable;
e) Particulars of issue, receipt, opening of the bids and the participating bidders at
each stage;
f) Requests for clarifications and any reply thereof including the clarifications given
during pre-bid conferences;
g) Bids evaluated, and documents relating to their evaluation;
h) Contracts and Contract Amendment; and Complaint handling, correspondences
with Procuring Entities, consultants, banks.

Appendix– 2: Legal Aspects of Public Procurement
1.0

Relevant Provisions of the Constitution of India

1.1

Equality for Bidders

Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India
(under Part III – ‘Fundamental Rights’) grants
all its citizens the right “to practise any
profession or to carry out any occupation,
trade or business”. This has been interpreted
by courts in a way so as to ensure that every
citizen of India has a right to get equal
opportunity to bid for and be considered for a
public procurement contract. However, this
provision does permit stipulation of reasonable
eligibility or pre-qualification criteria for the
selection of successful bidders in a public
procurement contract. Thus a public
procurement organisation should be ready to
prove in court that no eligible bidder has been
denied reasonable and equal opportunity
under this article to bid and be considered for
the concerned contract.

1.2
Persons Authorised to Make and
Execute Contracts on Behalf of
Governments

“Part III - FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS - Right to
Freedom
§19 Protection of certain rights regarding
freedom of speech, etc.
(1) All citizens shall have the right(a) to freedom of speech and expression;
(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;
(c) to form associations or unions;
(d) to move freely throughout the territory of
India;
(e) to reside and settle in any part of the
territory of India; [and]
(g) to practise any profession, or to carry on
any occupation, trade or business.”
“Part XII. - Finance, Property, Contracts and
Suits
§299 Contracts:
All contracts made in the exercise of the
executive power of the Union or of a State
shall be expressed to be made by the
President, or by the Governor of the State, as
the case may be, and all such contracts and
all assurances of property made in the
exercise of that power shall be executed on
behalf of the President or the Governor by
such persons and in such manner as he may
direct or authorise.
Neither the President nor the Governor shall
be personally liable in respect of any contract
or assurance made or executed for the
purposes of this Constitution, or for the
purposes of any enactment relating to the
Government of India heretofore in force, nor
shall any person making or executing any
such contract or assurance on behalf of any
of them be personally liable in respect
thereof.”

As per Article 299 (Part XII – Finance, Property,
Contracts and Suits) of the Constitution of India,
all contracts on behalf of the Union Government
or state governments are to be entered into and
executed by authorised persons on behalf of
the President of India or Governor of the state,
respectively. The President of India, Governor
of the state and the authorised persons who
enter into or execute such contracts are granted
immunity from personal liability under this
article. That is why, above the signatures of
such persons, on the contract documents, a
legal phrase “For and on Behalf of the President
of India/ the Governor of State” is written to
signify this fact. In a state government, the
persons who are authorised to do so are listed in the DFPR. Provisions of DFPR are expanded
upon by various departments by issuing SOPs. Rule 224, Chapter 8: Contract Management
of the GFR 2017 covers this aspect also

170

1.3

Other Mercantile Laws

A procurement contract besides being a commercial transaction is also a legal transaction.
There are a number of commercial/ mercantile laws that are applicable equally to the private
sector and public procurement, such as the Indian Contract Act, Sales of Goods Act,
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and so on. Although a public procurement professional is
expected to have a working knowledge of the following basic laws relating to procurement, yet
he is not expected to be a legal expert. If standard contract forms are used, the procurement
official can discharge his normal functions without frequent legal help. In case any complex
legal issue arises, or a complex contract beyond the standard contract form is to be drafted,
an appropriate legal professional may be associated with the procurement from an early stage.
Salient features of these mercantile laws relating to Procurement are summarised below.

2.0
2.1

Salient Features of the Indian Contract Act
Elementary Legal Practices

2.1.1

What is a Contract? The proposal or offer when accepted is a promise, a promise
and every set of promises forming the consideration for each other is an agreement
and an agreement if made with free consent of parties competent to contract, for a
lawful consideration and with a lawful object is a contract.

2.1.2

Proposal or Offer: When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or to
abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of the other to such
act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal or offer. In a sale or purchase by
tender, the tender signed by the tenderer is the proposal. The invitation to tender
and instructions to tenderers do not constitute a proposal.

2.1.3

Acceptance of the Proposal: When the person to whom the proposal is made
signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A proposal when
accepted becomes a promise.

2.1.4

What agreements are contracts: An agreement is a contract enforceable by law
when the following are satisfied. A defect affecting any of these renders a contract
un-enforceable

2.2

i)

Competency of the parties

ii)

Freedom of consent of both parties

iii)

Lawfulness of consideration

iv)

Lawfulness of object

Competency of Parties

Under law any person who has attained majority and is of sound mind or not debarred by law
to which he is subject, may enter into contracts. It, therefore, follows that minors and persons
of unsound mind cannot enter into contracts nor can insolvent person do so.
2.2.1 Categories of persons and bodies who are parties to the contract may be broadly subdivided under the following heads: i) Individuals;
ii)
Partnerships;
iii)
Limited Companies;
iv)
Corporations other than limited companies

171

2.2.2 Contracts with Individuals: Individuals tender either in their own name or in the
name and style of their business. If the tender is signed by any person other than the
concerned individual, the authority of the person signing the tender on behalf of another
must be verified and a proper power of attorney authorizing such person should be insisted
on. In case, a tender is submitted in a business name and if it is a concern of an individual,
the constitution of the business and the capacity of the individual must appear on the face
of the contract and the tender signed by the individual himself as proprietor or by his duly
authorized attorney.
2.2.3 Contracts with Partnerships: A partnership is an association of two or more
individuals formed for the purpose of doing business jointly under a business name. It is also
called a firm. It should be noted that a partnership is not a legal entity by itself, apart from the
individuals constituting it. A partner is the implied authority to bind the firm in a contract
coming in the purview of the usual business of the firm. The implied authority of a partner,
however, does not extend to enter into arbitration agreement on behalf of the firm. While
entering into a contract with partnership firm care should be taken to verify the existence of
consent of all the partners to the arbitration agreement.
2.2.4 Contracts with Limited Companies: Companies are associations of individuals
registered under Companies Act in which the liability of the members comprising the
association is limited to the extent of the shares held by them in such companies. The
company, after its incorporation or registration, is an artificial legal person which has an
existence quite distinct and separate from the members of shareholders comprising the
same. A company is not empowered to enter into a contract for purposes not covered by its
memorandum of association; any such agreement in excess of power entered into the
company is void and cannot be enforced. Therefore, in cases of doubt, the company must be
asked to produce its memorandum for verification or the position may be verified by an
inspection of the memorandum from the office of the Registrar of Companies before entering
into a contract. Normally, any one of the Directors of the company is empowered to present
the company. Where tenders are signed by persons other than Directors or authorized
Managing Agents, it may be necessary to examine if the person signing the tender is
authorized by the company to enter into contracts on its behalf.
2.2.5 Corporation other than Limited Companies: Associations of individuals
incorporated under statutes such as Trade Union Act, Co- operative Societies Act and
Societies Registration Act are also artificial persons in the eye of law and are entitled to enter
into such contracts as are authorized by their memorandum of association. If any contract
has to be entered into with any one or such corporations or associations, the capacity of such
associations to enter into contract should be verified and also the authority of the person
coming forward to represent the said Association.

2.3

Consent of both Parties

Two or more persons are said to consent when they agree upon the same thing in the same
sense. When two persons dealing with each other have their minds directed to different
objects or attach different meanings to the language which they use, there is no agreement.
The misunderstanding which is incompatible with agreement may occur in the following
cases: i)

When the misunderstanding relates to the identity of the other party to the agreement;

ii)

When it relates to the nature or terms of the transactions;

172

iii)

When it related to the subject matter of the agreement.

2.4

Free consent of both Parties

2.4.1

The consent is said to be free when it is not caused by coercion, undue influence,
fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. Consent is said to be so caused when it would
not have been given but for the existence of coercion, undue influence, fraud,
misrepresentation or mistake. When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion,
undue influence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at
the option of the party whose consent was caused. A party to a contract, whose
consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation, may, if he thinks fit, insist that
the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he
would have been if there presentations made had been true.

2.4.2

In case consent to an agreement has been given under a mistake, the position is
slightly different. When both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to
a matter essential to the agreement, the agreement is not voidable but void. When
the mistake is unilateral on the part of one party only, the agreement is not void.

2.4.3

Distinction has also to be drawn between a mistake off act and a mistake of law. A
contract is not void because it was caused by a mistake as to any law in force in
India but a mistake as to law not in force in India has the same effect as a mistake
of fact.

2.5

Consideration

Consideration is something which is advantageous to the promisor or which is onerous or
disadvantageous to the promisee. Inadequacy of consideration is, however, not a ground
avoiding the contract. But an act, forbearance or promise which is contemplation of law has
no value is no consideration and likewise an actor a promise which is illegal or impossible
has no value.

2.6

Lawfulness of object

The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless it is forbidden by law or is of
such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent or
involves or implies injury to the fraudulent property of another or the court regards it as
immoral or opposed to public policy. In each of these cases the consideration or object of an
agreement is said to be unlawful.

2.7

Communication of an Offer or Proposal

The communication of a proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person
to whom it is made. A time is generally provided in the tender forms for submission of the
tender. Procuring Entity is not bound to consider a tender, which is received beyond that time.

2.8

Communication of Acceptance

A date is invariably fixed in tender forms up to which tenders are open for acceptance. A
proposal or offer stands revoked by the lapse of time prescribed in such offer for its
acceptance. If, therefore, in case it is not possible to decide a tender within the period of
validity of the offer as originally made, the consent of the tenderer firm should be obtained to
keep the offer open for further period or periods.
The communication of an acceptance is complete as against the proposer or offerer, where
it is put in the course of transmission to him, so as to be out of the power of the acceptor,

173

and it is complete as against the acceptor when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer
or offerer. The medium of communication in government contracts is generally by post and
the acceptance is, therefore, complete as soon as it is posted. So that there might be no
possibility of a dispute regarding the date of communication of acceptance, it should be sent
to the correct address by some authentic foolproof mode like registered post
acknowledgement due, etc.

2.9

Acceptance to be identical with Proposal

If the terms of the tender or the tender, as revised, and modified, are not accepted or if the
terms of the offer and the acceptance are not the same, the acceptance remains a mere
counter offer and there is no concluded contract. It should, therefore, be ensured that the
terms incorporated in the acceptance are not at variance with the offer or the tender and that
none of the terms of the tender are left out. In case, uncertain terms are used by the tenderers,
clarifications should be obtained before such tenders are considered for acceptance. If it is
considered that a counter offer should be made, such counter offer should be carefully
drafted, as a contract is to take effect on acceptance thereof.
If the subject matter of the contract is impossible of fulfil mentor is in itself in violation of law
such contract is void.

2.10

Withdrawal of an Offer or Proposal

A tenderer firm, who is the proposer may withdraw its offer at any time before its acceptance,
even though the firm might have offered to keep the offer open for a specified period. It is
equally open to the tenderer to revise or modify his offer before its acceptance. Such
withdrawal, revision or modification must reach the accepting authority before the date and
time of opening of tender.
No legal obligations arise out of such withdrawal or revision or modification of the offer as a
simple offer is without a consideration. Where, however, a tenderer agrees to keep his offer
open for a specified period for a consideration, such offers cannot be withdrawn before the
expiry of the specified date. This would be so where earnest money is deposited by the
tenderer in consideration of his being supplied the subsidiary contract and withdrawal of offer
by the tenderer before the specified period would entitle the Procuring Entity to forfeit the
earnest money.

2.11

Withdrawal of Acceptance

An acceptance can be withdrawn before such acceptance comes to the knowledge of the
tenderer. A telegraphic revocation of acceptance, which reaches the tenderer before the letter
of acceptance, will be a valid revocation.

2.12

Changes in terms of a concluded Contract

No variation in the terms of a concluded contract can be made without the consent of the
parties. While granting extensions or making any other variation, the consent of the contractor
must be taken. While extensions are to be granted on an application of the contractor, the
letter and spirit of the application should be kept in view in fixing a time for delivery.

2.13

Discharge of Contracts

A contract is discharged or the parties are normally freed from the obligation of a contract by
due performance of the terms of the contract. A contract may also be discharged: i)

By mutual agreement: If neither party has performed the contract, no consideration
is required for the release. If a party has performed a part of the contract and has

174

undergone expenses in arranging to fulfil the contract, it is necessary for the parties
to agree to a reasonable value of the work done as consideration for the value.
ii)

By breach: In case a party to a contract breaks some stipulation in the contract which
goes to the root of transaction, or destroys the foundation of the contract or prevents
substantial performance of the contract, it discharges the innocent party to proceed
further with the performance and entitles him to a right of action for damages and to
enforce the remedies for such breach as provided in the contract itself. A breach of
contract may, however, be waived.

iii)

By refusal of a party to perform: On a promisor’s refusal to perform the contract or
repudiation there of even before the arrival of the time for performance, the promisee
may at his option treat the repudiation as an immediate breach putting an end to the
contract for the future. In such a case the promisee has a right of immediate action
for damages.

iv)

In a contract where there are reciprocal promises: If one party to the contract
prevents the other party from performing the contract, the contract may be put to an
end at the instance of the party so prevented and the contract is thereby discharged.

2.14

Stamping of Contracts

Under entry 5 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, an agreement or memorandum of
agreement for correlating to the sale of goods or merchandise exclusively is exempt from
payment of stamp duty. (A note or memorandum sent by a Broker or Agent to his principal
intimating the purchase or sale on account of such principal is not so exempt from stamp
duty.)
The Stamp Act provides that no Stamp Duty shall be chargeable in respect of any instrument
executed by or on behalf of or in favour of the Government in cases where but for such
exemption Government would be liable to pay the duty chargeable in respect of such
instrument. (Cases in which Government would be liable are set out in Section 29 of the Act).

2.15

Authority for Execution of Contracts

As per Clause 1 of Article 299 of the Constitution, the contracts and assurances of property
made in the exercise of the executive power of the Union shall be executed on behalf of the
President. The words “for and on behalf of the President of India” should therefore follow the
designation appended below the signature of the officer authorized in this behalf.
Note 1:

The various classes of contracts and assurances of property, which may be
executed by different authorities, are specified in the Notifications issued by
the Ministry of Law from time to time.

Note 2:

The powers of various authorities, the conditions under which such powers
should be exercised and the general procedure prescribed with regard to
various classes of contracts and assurances of property are laid down in Rule
21 of the Delegation of Financial Powers Rules.

2.16

Contract Effective Date

The date of commencement of the obligations under the contract on the parties to a contract
is referred as the contract effective date. This date should be invariably indicated in each
contract, as per agreed terms and conditions. The Ministries/ Departments are advised to set
the effective date to be a date after the following:

175

i)

Date of signing of the contract.

ii) Furnishing of performance bond in terms of performance security.
iii) Receipt of Bank Guarantee for advance payment.
iv)

Obtaining Export Licence for supply of stores by seller and confirmation by the
buyer.

v)

Receipt of End User's Certificate. The supplier shall provide the End User's
Certificate within 30 (thirty) days of the signing of the contract.

3.0
Salient Features of the Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 and
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015
Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996 provides for dispute settlement either by a process
of conciliation and/ or by arbitration. This act is based on a 'United Nation’s Commission on
International Trade Law Model Arbitration Law' with an object to minimise the supervisory role
of courts in the arbitral process and to provide that every final arbitral award is enforced in the
same manner, as if it was a decree of the court. It covers both international and domestic
arbitration and conciliation.

3.1

Arbitration

Arbitration is one of the oldest methods of settling civil disputes arising out of and in the course
of performance of the contract between two or more persons by reference of the dispute to an
independent and impartial third person called the arbitrator, instead of litigating the matter in
the usual way through the courts. It saves time and expense, avoids unnecessary
technicalities and, at the same time, ensures “substantial justice within limits of the law”.

3.2

Arbitrator, Arbitration and Arbitral Award

The person or persons appointed to determine differences and disputes are called the
arbitrator or arbitral tribunal. The proceeding before him is called arbitration proceedings. The
decision is called an Award. For the purpose of Law of Limitations, The Arbitration for a
particular dispute is deemed to have commenced on the date, on which a request for
arbitration is received by the respondent.

3.3

Arbitration Agreement

It is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes, which have
arisen or which may arise between them, in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether
contractual or non-contractual. The dispute resolution method of arbitration, as per the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, can be invoked only if there is an arbitration agreement (in
the form of an arbitration clause or a separate arbitration agreement) in the contract. If there
is such an agreement, courts are barred from directly entertaining any litigation in respect of
such contracts, and are bound instead to refer the parties to arbitration.

3.4

Appointment and Composition of Arbitral Tribunal

Both parties can mutually agree on the number of arbitrators (which cannot be an even
number) to be appointed. In case there is no agreement, a single (sole) arbitrator may be
appointed. The parties can mutually agree on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or
arbitrators, or else in case of arbitration with three arbitrators, each party will appoint one
arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators will appoint the third arbitrator, who will act as a
presiding arbitrator. If one party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 (thirty) days, or if the
two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator, then the court may appoint any

176

person or institution as arbitrator. In case of an international commercial dispute, the
application for appointment of arbitrator has to be made to the Chief Justice of India. In case
of other domestic disputes, the application has to be made to the Chief Justice of the High
Court within whose jurisdiction the parties are situated.

3.5

Challenge to Appointment of Arbitrator

An arbitrator is expected to be independent and impartial. If there are some circumstances
due to which his independence or impartiality can be challenged, he must disclose the
circumstances before his appointment. The appointment of an arbitrator cannot be challenged
on any ground, except when there is justifiable doubt as to the arbitrator’s independence or
impartiality or when he does not possess the qualifications for the arbitrator agreed to by the
parties. The challenge to appointment has to be decided by the arbitrator himself. If he does
not accept the challenge, the arbitration can continue and the arbitrator can make the arbitral
award. However, in such a case, application for setting aside the arbitral award can be made
to the court, after the award is made by the arbitrator. Thus the other party cannot stall further
arbitration proceedings by rushing to court.

3.6

Conduct of Arbitral Proceedings

The parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed for conducting proceedings,
location, language of hearings and written proceedings. Failing any agreement, the arbitral
tribunal may decide themselves on these aspects. The parties shall be treated with equality
and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present its case. The arbitral tribunal shall
observe the rules of natural justice but is bound neither by Civil Procedure Code 1908 nor by
Indian Evidence Act 1872. Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable from the date of commencement
of arbitral proceedings. Arbitral tribunals have powers to do the following:
Determine admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence;
i)

Decide on their own jurisdiction;

ii) Decide on interim measures;
iii) Termination of proceedings; and
iv) Seek court assistance in taking evidence.

3.7

Arbitral Award

The decision of the arbitral tribunal is termed as 'arbitral award'. The decision of arbitral tribunal
shall be by majority. The arbitral award shall be in writing, mentioning the place and date, and
signed by the members of the tribunal. It must state the reasons for the award. A copy of the
award should be given to each party. The tribunal can make interim award also. An arbitral
award is enforceable in the same manner as if it were a decree of the court.

3.8

Recourse against Arbitral Award

Recourse to a court against an arbitration award can be made by an application (within three
months from the date of the arbitral award), only on the grounds specified in the act, that is,
the party was under some incapacity; arbitration agreement was not valid; proper opportunity
was not given to present the case; award deal with disputes not falling within the terms of
reference of arbitrator; composition of the arbitral tribunal is not as per agreement of parties;
subject matter of dispute is not capable of settlement through arbitration under the law or the
arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy.

3.9

Conciliation
177

This is a new concept added in the Act for settlement of disputes. The party initiating
conciliation shall send a written invitation to the other party to conciliate and proceedings shall
commence when the other party accepts the initiations to conciliation. The parties may agree
on the name of a sole conciliator or each party may appoint one conciliator. The conciliation
shall assist the parties to reach an amicable settlement of their dispute. When the parties sign
the settlement agreement, it shall be final and binding on the parties. The conciliator shall
authenticate the settlement agreement and furnish a copy thereof to each party. This process
has not yet come into a common use.

3.10 Changes introduced by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)
Act, 2015
i)
Independence, Disqualification and Obligations of arbitrators at the time of
appointment
a)
Independence, Impartiality and Accountability of Arbitrators: A fixed fee
structure ensures the independence of the arbitral tribunal and also provides a
reasonable cost estimate to the parties entering into arbitration. The Amendment Act
in the Fourth Schedule prescribes the model fees for arbitrators and the High Courts
have been assigned the responsibility of framing the rules for determination of the fees
and the manner of its payment. The model fee varies from Rs 45,000 to Rs 30 (thirty)
lakh for various slabs of disputed value from Rs five lakh to above Rs 20 (twenty) crore
- with a sole arbitrator entitles to 25 (twenty-five) percent extra above the model
fee).However it is clarified that such fees shall not be applicable in International
Commercial Arbitration and in cases where parties have agreed for determination of
fees as per the rules of an arbitral institution.
b)
Disqualification from appointment: A long and exhaustive list of specific
circumstances which shall act as a bar against any person from being appointed as an
arbitrator in a dispute, have been enumerated in the seventh schedule. However, the
parties to the dispute have been given the opportunity, after the dispute has arisen, to
waive the applicability of the seventh schedule, by mutual written agreement, if they so
deem fit. Especially of interest in Public Procurement is disqualification of past or
present employees, consultant, advisors or other related business relationship not only
with the Procuring Entity but also with any affiliated entity thereof. Thus the earlier
practice of appointing serving officers of procuring entity as arbitrator is no more legal.
c)
Disclosures: An arbitrator who is approached for appointment is obligated to
disclose as per Sixth Schedule of the Act. The declaration as per a set format removes
any ambiguity and ensures uniformity.
d)
conflict of Interest the existence either direct or indirect, of any past or present
relationship with or interest in any of the parties or in relation to the subject matter in
dispute, whether financial, business, professional or other kind, which is likely to give
rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality as per fifth schedule to
the Act for arbitrator.
e)
Time constraints: An arbitrator shall disclose all circumstances which may
affect his ability to deliver an award within 12 (twelve) months.

ii)

Fast-tracking Arbitration in India

178

a)
Award within 12 (twelve) months: The arbitral tribunal is statutorily obligated
to deliver an award within 12 (twelve) months from the date when arbitral tribunal
enters into reference. The arbitral tribunal is said to have entered upon the reference
on the date on which the arbitrator(s) have received notice of their appointment. The
award can be delayed by a maximum period of six months only under the special
circumstances where all parties give their consent to such extension of time. Where
the award is not made out within the statutory period the mandate of arbitrators shall
automatically terminate. It is open for the courts to extend the time period for making
an award upon receipt of an application by any of the parties. Such extension is to be
granted only for sufficient cause and the court in its discretion may impose the following
penalties depending on the facts and circumstances of the case:
1. Reduce the fees of arbitrators by up to five percent for each month of delay.
2. Substitute one or all the arbitrators.
3. Impose actual or exemplary costs on any of the parties.
b)
Oral arguments to be held on a day-to-day basis: Oral arguments as far as
possible shall be heard by the arbitral tribunal on a day to day basis and no
adjournments shall be granted without sufficient cause. Provision for imposition of
exemplary cost on the party seeking adjournment without sufficient cause has also
been made.
c)
Fast Track Procedure: The parties to arbitration may choose to opt for a new
fast track procedure either before or after the commencement of the arbitration. The
award in fast track arbitration is to be made out within six months. Where the Arbitral
Tribunal delivers the award within a period of six months the arbitral tribunal shall be
entitled to additional fees. The quantum of such additional fees shall be determined by
the parties. The salient features of the fast track arbitration are:
1.

Dispute is to be decided based on written pleadings only.

2.
Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power to call for clarifications in addition
to the written pleadings where it deems necessary.
3.
Oral hearing maybe held only if all the parties make a request or if the
arbitral tribunal considers it necessary.
4.

The parties are free to decide the fees of the arbitrator(s).

d)
Appointment within 60 (sixty) days: Whenever an application for
appointment of Arbitrator(s) is moved before a court such application shall be disposed
of as expeditiously as possible and an endeavour shall be made to dispose of the
matter within a period of sixty days from the date of service of notice on the opposite
party. The court while appointing arbitrators shall confine itself to the examination of
the existence of an arbitration agreement.

iii)

Procedural and Jurisprudence simplified
i) Arbitration to commence within 90 (ninety) days of interim relief: Where
the court grants interim relief before the commencement of arbitration, the
arbitration must commence within 90 (ninety) days from such order of interim relief.
The court however has been given the authority to extend the period within which
the arbitration must commence, if it deems such extension necessary. The Act

179

prohibits courts from entertaining any application for interim relief once the
arbitration has entered into reference, unless the court finds that circumstances
exist which may not render the remedy provided under section 17 efficacious.
ii) Powers of Interim Relief in Section 9 also to Arbitral Tribunal: The parties
to arbitration can now directly approach the arbitral tribunal for seeking interim relief
on the same grounds as were available to the parties under section 9 of the
previous act. Further, the tribunal has now been granted the powers of a court while
making interim awards in the proceedings before it.
iii) Arbitral tribunal not bound to rule in accordance with terms of the
contract: The arbitral tribunal was previously bound to deliver an award in
accordance with the terms of the agreement and was required to take into
consideration the ‘usages of the trade applicable to the transaction’. Vide the
Amendment the arbitral tribunal has been freed of the obligation to only rule in
accordance with the terms of the agreement. The arbitral tribunal is only required
to take the agreement into account while delivering its award and is free to deviate
from the terms of the agreement if the circumstances so warrant.
iv) Act made applicable on International Commercial Arbitration with even seat
outside India: Part I of the act has been made applicable for limited purpose (listed
below) on International Commercial Arbitrations even in instances where the seat
of the arbitration is outside India, however giving freedom to exclude the
applicability the Act by entering into an agreement to this effect.

iv)

Seeking interim relief from courts [section 9]
i)

Seeking the assistance of the court in taking evidence [section 27]

ii) Appealing against the order of a court where the court refuses to refer the
parties to arbitration. [section 37(1) (a)]
iii) Restricting the right to second appeal and preserving the right of parties to
approach the Supreme Court in appeal. [section 37 (3)]

Salient Features of Competition Act, 2002 relating to Anti-competitive
Practices
i)
The Preamble of the Competition Act, 2002, provides for the establishment of a

ii)
iii)

Commission keeping in view of the economic development of the country to promote
and sustain competition in markets; prevent practices having adverse effect on
competition; protect consumer interest; and ensure freedom of trade carried on by
participants in Indian markets.
The Act was amended by Competition (Amendment) Act, 2007 and again by
Competition (Amendment Act), 2009.
In India, Competition Commission of India (“CCI”), formulated under the
Competition Act is a quasi-judicial and regulatory body entrusted with the task
enforcement of the Competition Act, 2002. Apart from specific functions under the
Competition Act, 2002 the CCI also has extra-territorial jurisdiction, inquiry into
anticompetitive conduct, sector-specific regulatory work, competition advocacy, power
of appointment of professional and experts, and procedure for investigation (in terms
of regulating its own procedure).

180

iv)

v)

vi)

vii)

Section 8 dealing with composition of Commission provides for a chairperson and
not less than two and not more than six members which are to be appointed by
Central Government. The CCI is vested with inquisitorial, investigative, regulatory,
adjudicatory and also advisory jurisdiction. Vast powers have been given to the
Commission and under Section 64, the Commission can frame regulations.
The Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) is another body entrusted with the
responsibility of hearing and disposing of appeals against any direction or decision or
order of the CCI. It also adjudicates on compensation claims arising from the findings
of the CCI or its own findings on appeals against the CCI orders and passes orders on
the recovery of compensation.
Any person aggrieved by the order or decision of the CCI may prefer an appeal to the
Competition Appellate Tribunal (‘COMPAT’) within 60 (sixty) days from the date of
communication of such order or decision. The second and final appeal under Section
53T lies before the Supreme Court of India from the orders of the COMPAT within a
period of 60 (sixty) days from the date of communication of the order by the COMPAT.
CCI may initiate an inquiry:
i) On its own motion on the basis of information and knowledge in its possession,
or
ii) On receipt of any information, in such manner and accompanied by such fee
as may be determined by regulations, from any person, consumer or their
association or trade association, or
iii) On receipt of a reference from the Central Government or a State Government
or a statutory authority

viii)

ix)

x)

xi)

The Act provides for Director General office as a separate investigative wing to assist
the CCI. The DG looks into the complaints received from the CCI and submits all
findings to it. DG is solely responsible for making enquiries, for examining documents
and for making investigations into complaints. The DG is vested under the Act with
powers of summoning of witnesses, examining them on oath, requiring the discovery
and production of documents, receiving evidence on affidavits, issuing commissions
for the examination of witnesses etc.
The Act in Section 49 (3) lays down the advocacy function of CCI and lays down that
the CCI shall take suitable measures for the promotion of competition advocacy,
creating awareness and imparting training about competition issues. Section 32 of the
Act grants the CCI extra-territorial jurisdiction over anticompetitive conduct which
has an appreciable adverse effect on competition within India. Any anticompetitive
activity taking place outside India but having an appreciable adverse effect on
competition within India shall be subject to the application of the Competition Act.
Under s. 21 of the Act, any statutory authority can suo motto or on request of a party
in the course of a proceeding before it can make a reference to CCI. CCI shall give
its opinion within sixty days of receipt of such reference by such statutory authority.
Under the provisions of the Act, the authority which made reference shall consider the
opinion of the Commission and thereafter, give its findings recording reasons on the
issues referred to in the said opinion by CCI. Section 21A in the same language
provides for such reference by CCI to any statutory authority.
The key provisions of the Competition Act include:

181

i) Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002 dealing with anti-competitive
agreements;
ii) Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 which discusses abuse of dominance;
iii) Section 5 and 6 of the Competition Act, 2002 dealing with the regulation of
combinations.
iv) The term ‘agreement’, has been defined broadly in the Competition Act. It
extends to a mere ‘arrangement’, ‘understanding’ or ‘action in concert’, none of
which need be in writing or enforceable by law.
v) Section 3(1) of the Competition Act lays down that no enterprise or association
of enterprises or person or association of persons shall enter into any agreement
in respect of production, supply, distribution, storage, acquisition or control of
goods or provision of services, which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable
adverse effect on competition within India. The Act prohibits an anti-competitive
agreement and declares that such an agreement shall be void.
vi) Section 3(3) of the Competition Act deals with the horizontal agreements as it
covers the agreements between entities engaged in identical or similar trade of
goods or provision of services. It also includes cartels. The section covers:
vii) Agreement entered into between enterprises or associations of enterprises or
persons or associations of persons or between any person and enterprise
viii) Practice carried on by any association of enterprises or association of persons
ix) Decision taken by any association of enterprises or association of persons
x) Section 3(3) of the Competition Act enlists four broad classifications of
horizontal agreements which are presumed to cause an appreciable adverse effect
on competition (AAEC) in India.
1.

Agreements regarding Prices

2.

Agreements regarding Quantity/ Quality

3.

Market Allocation

4.

Bid Rigging

These four horizontal agreements are not presumed to have appreciable adverse effect on
competition and excluded from the provisions of Section 3(3) of the Competition Act, 2002
provided they are entered into by way of joint ventures and increase efficiency in production,
supply, distribution, storage, acquisition or control of goods or provision of services.
Cartels, by their very nature are secretive and thus it is difficult to find the direct evidence of
their presence. The orders of the CCI clearly point that CCI relies on circumstantial evidence,
both economic and conduct-based, to reach its decision on the existence of a cartel
agreement.
The Act provides a definition for bid rigging and it covers agreements having effect of
eliminating or reducing competition for bids or adversely affecting or manipulating the process
for bidding:
4.1
Collusive bidding: Agreement between firms to divide the market, set prices or limit
production – involves, kickbacks and misrepresentation of independence

182

i)

Bid Rotation

ii)

Bid Suppression

iii)

Complementary Bidding

iv)

Subcontracting arrangements

v)

Market Allocation

4.2
The Act gives wide discretion to CCI to frame the remedies to overcome the
anticompetitive situation:
i)

Declare Anticompetitive Agreements Void

ii)

Impose Heavy Penalties
1. Penalty can be up to 10 (ten) percent of the average turnover for the last three
preceding financial years upon each of such persons or enterprises which are
parties to bid-rigging
2. Cartel, a penalty of up to three times of its profit for each year of the continuance
of such agreement or 10 (ten) percent of its turnover for each year of the
continuance of such agreement, whichever is higher
3. Order the parties to Cease & Desist
4. Modification of agreements
5. Remedy Damage to reputation
6. Fix Individual Liability
7. Grant Interim orders
8. Any other order as CCI deems fit

4.3
Who can file the information: Raising issues regarding anti-competitive behaviour
for action by CCI under the act is called filing the information:
1. Any person, consumer or their association or trade association can file information
before the Commission.
2. Central Govt. or a State Govt. or a statutory authority can also make a reference
to the Commission for making an inquiry.
3. “Person” includes an individual, HUF, firm, company, local authority, cooperative
or any artificial juridical person.
4.4

What are the issues on which information can be filed?
1. The information can be filed on the issues like anti-competitive agreements and
abuse of dominant position or a combination.
2. Class of consumers.

4.5

The fee 1. Rupees 5000/ - (Five thousand only) in case of individual, or Hindu undivided family
(HUF), or Non-Government Organisation (NGO), or Consumer Association, or Cooperative Society, or Trust, duly registered under the respective Acts,

183

2. Rupees 20,000/ -(twenty thousand only) in case of firms, companies having

initiating proceedings against the concerned public servant or other administrative and
corrective steps. However, in case the public authority does not agree with the
recommendation of the Designated Agency, it shall record the reasons for such
disagreement.

Appendix 3: Electronic Procurement (e-Procurement)
(The details given in this appendix are generic in nature are not prescriptive part of this
Manual. Procuring Entities may settle and decide the details with the service provider)

1.0

Electronic procurement (e-procurement)

i)

Electronic Procurement (e-Procurement) is the use of information and communication
technology (specially the internet) by the Procuring Entity in conducting procurement
processes with the vendors/ contractors for the acquisition of goods (supplies), works
and services aimed at open, non-discriminatory and efficient procurement through
transparent procedures. As per GFR 2017, it is now mandatory for Ministries/
Departments to receive all bids through e procurement portals in respect of all
procurements.

ii)

Ministries/ Departments which do not have a large volume of procurement or carry out
procurements required only for day-to-day running of offices and also have not initiated
e-procurement through any other solution provider so far may use e-procurement
solution developed by NIC. Other Ministries/ Departments may either use eprocurement solution developed by NIC or engage any other service provider following
due process.

iii)

These instructions will not apply to procurements made by Ministries/ Departments
through Government E-Markets (GeM).

iv)

In individual cases where national security and strategic considerations demands
confidentiality, Ministries/ Departments may exempt such cases from e-procurement
after seeking approval of concerned Secretary and with concurrence of Financial
Advisers.

v)

In case of tenders floated by Indian Missions abroad, Competent Authority to decide
the tender, may exempt such case from e-procurement.

2.0

Service Provider

A service provider is engaged to provide an e-procurement system covering the following:

i)

All steps involved, starting from hosting of tenders to determination of technocommercially acceptable lowest bidder, are covered;

ii)

The system archives the information and generates reports required for the
management information system/ decision support system;

iii)

A helpdesk is available for online and offline support to different stakeholders;

iv)

The system arranges and updates the Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) for
departmental users; and

v)

Different documents, formats, and so on, for the e-procurement systems are available.

3.0

Process

In e-procurement, all processes of tendering have the same content as in normal tendering
and are executed, once the necessary changes have been made, online by using the DSC as
follows:

187

i)

Communications: Wherever traditional procedures refer to written communication
and documents, the corresponding process in e-procurement would be handled either
fully online by way of uploading/ downloading/ emails or automatically generated SMSs
or else partly online and partly offline submission. It is advisable to move to full
submissions online. More details would be available from e-procurement service
provider’s portal. In e-procurement, the tender fee, EMD and documents supporting
exemption from such payments are submitted in paper form to the authority nominated
in the NIT, but scanned copies are to be uploaded – without which the bid may not get
opened. In future, such payments may be allowed online also;

ii)

Publishing of tenders: Tenders are published on the e-procurement portal by
authorised executives of Procuring Entity with DSC. After the creation of the tender, a
unique "tender id" is automatically generated by the system. While creating/ publishing
the tender, the "bid openers" are identified – four officers (two from the procuring entity
and two from the associated/ integrated Finance) with a provision that tenders may be
opened by any two of the four officers. As in case of normal tenders, NITs are also
advertised in newspapers and posted on the Procuring Entity website. The
downloading of the tender may start immediately after e-publication of NIT and can
continue till the last date and time of bid submission. The bid submission will start from
the next day of e-publication of NIT. In case of limited and PAC/ single tenders,
information should also be sent to target vendors/ contractors through SMS/ email by
the portal;

iii)

Registration of bidders on portal: In order to submit the bid, bidders have to register
themselves online, as a one-time activity, on the e-procurement portal with a valid
DSC. The registration should be in the name of the bidder, whereas DSC holder may
be either the bidder himself or a duly authorised person. The bidders will have to
accept, unconditionally, the online user portal agreement which contains all the terms
and conditions of NIT including commercial and general terms and conditions and other
conditions, if any, along with an online undertaking in support of the authenticity of the
declarations regarding facts, figures, information and documents furnished by the
bidder online;

iv)

Bid submission: The bidders will submit their techno-commercial bids and price bids
online. No conditional bid shall be allowed/ accepted. Bidders will have to upload
scanned copies of various documents required for eligibility and all other documents
as specified in NIT, techno-commercial bid in cover-I, and price bid in cover-II. To
enable system generated techno-commercial and price comparative statements, such
statements should be asked to be submitted in Excel formats. The bidder will have to
give an undertaking online that if the information/ declaration/ scanned documents
furnished in respect of eligibility criteria are found to be wrong or misleading at any
stage, they will be liable to punitive action. EMD and tender fee (demand draft/ banker’s
cheque/ pay order) shall be submitted in the electronic format online (by scanning)
while uploading the bid. This submission shall mean that EMD and tender fee are
received electronically. However, for the purpose of realisation, the bidder shall send
the demand draft/ banker’s cheque/ pay order in original to the designated officer
through post or by hand so as to reach by the time of tender opening. In case of
exemption of EMD, the scanned copy of the document in support of exemption will
have to be uploaded by the bidder during bid submission;

188

v)

Corrigendum, clarifications, modifications and withdrawal of bids: All these steps
are also carried out online mutatis mutandis the normal tendering process;

vi)

Bid opening: Both the techno-commercial and price bids are opened online by the bid
openers mentioned at the time of creation of the tender online. Relevant bidders can
simultaneously take part in bid opening online and can see the resultant bids of all
bidders. The system automatically generates a technical scrutiny report and
commercial scrutiny report in case of the techno-commercial bid opening and a price
comparative statement in case of price bid opening which can also be seen by
participating bidders online. Bid openers download the bids and the reports/
statements and sign them for further processing. In case of opening of the price bid,
the date and time of opening is uploaded on the portal and shortlisted firms are also
informed through system generated emails and SMS alerts – after shortlisting of the
techno-commercially acceptable bidders;

vii)

Shortfall document: Any document not enclosed by the bidder can be asked for, as
in case of the traditional tender, by the Procuring Entity and submitted by the bidder
online, provided it does not vitiate the tendering process;

viii)

Evaluation of techno-commercial and price bids: This is done offline in the same
manner as in the normal tendering process, based on system generated reports and
comparative statements;

ix)

Award of contract: Award of the contract is done offline and a scanned copy is
uploaded on the portal. More needs to be done in this regard. The information and the
manner of disclosure in this regard must conform to Section 4(1) (b), 4(2) and 4(3) of
the RTI Act to enhance transparency and also to reduce the need for filing individual
RTI applications. Therefore, the award must be published in a searchable format and
be linked to its NIT; and

x)

Return of EMD: EMD furnished by all unsuccessful bidders should be returned
through an e-payment system without interest, at the earliest, after the expiry of the
final tender validity period but not later than 30 (thirty) days after conclusion of the
contract. EMD of the successful bidder should be returned after receipt of performance
security as called for in the contract.

I. PRE BID STAGE

12

1.

Pre-qualification Criteria (PQC)

a.

To ensure that the pre-qualification criteria specified in the tender document
should neither be made very stringent nor very lax to restrict / facilitate the entry of
bidders.

b.

It should be ensured that the PQ criteria are exhaustive, yet specific and there is
fair competition.

c.

It should also be ensured that the PQ criteria is clearly stipulated in unambiguous
terms in the bid documents. (No. 98/ORD/1 Dtd. 04.09.2003 & No. 12-02-1-CTE6 Dtd. 07.05.2004).

d.

It is necessary to fix in advance the minimum qualification, experience and number
of similar works of a minimum magnitude satisfactorily executed in terms of quality
and period of execution. (No. 12-02-1-CTE-6 Dtd. 17.12.2002).

e.

Whatever pre-qualification, evaluation / exclusion criteria, etc. which the
organization wants to adopt should be made explicit at the time of inviting tenders
so that basic concept of transparency and interests of equity and fairness are
satisfied.

f.

The acceptance / rejection of any bid should not be arbitrary but on justified
grounds as per the laid down specifications, evaluation / exclusion criteria. (Ref
No.98/ORD/1 Dtd. 09.07.2003).

g.

It should be ensured that pre-qualification criteria, performance criteria and
evaluation criteria are incorporated in the bid documents in clear and unambiguous
terms as these criterions are very important to evaluate bids in a transparent
manner. Whenever required, the departments/organisations should follow two-bid
system, i.e. technical bid and price bid. The price bids should be opened only of
those vendors who were technically qualified by the Department / Organisation.
(Ref: No. 98/ORD/1 Dated 04.09.2003).

2.

Integrity Pact (IP)

a.

CVC recommends IP concept and encourages its adoption and implementation in
respect of all major procurements.

b.

Independent External Monitors (IEMs) to review independently and objectively
whether and to what extent parties have complied with their obligations under the
Pact.

c.

Entering into IP would be a preliminary qualification to participate in the bidding.

d.

Based on the proposal of panel of eminent persons to be appointed as IEMs by
the organisation, CVC would approve their appointment. (Ref: 007/VGL/033 Dtd.
04.12.2007, 28.12.2007 & 008/CRD/013 Dtd. 11.08.2009).

e.

Adoption of Integrity Pact in an organization is voluntary, but once adopted, it
should cover all tenders / procurements above a specified threshold value, which
should be set by the organization itself.

f.

In view of limited procurement activities in the Public Sector Banks, Insurance
Companies and Financial Institutions, they are exempted from adopting IP. (Ref:
No. 007/VGL/033 Dtd. the 05.08.2008).

g.

“Standard Operating Procedure” for adoption of Integrity Pact. Format for integrity
pact is enclosed to this Circular. (Ref: No. 008/CRD/013 Dtd. 18.05.2009).

h.

Organisation to select the names of the IEMs after due diligence and should
not propose the officer serving or retired from the same organisation (Ref: 009/
VGL/016 Dtd.19.04.2010). Maximum age limit for initial appointment of three
years or further extension of two years is 70. (Ref: 011/VGL/053 Dtd. 23.07.2012)
Organisations to undertake a general review and assessment of implementation
of IP and submit progress through CVO’s monthly report to the Commission.
(Ref: No. 008/CRD/013 Dated: 13.08.2010 & 008/CRD/013 Dtd 11.08.2009)

i.

The organizations, while forwarding the names of the persons for empanelment as
IEMs should sent a detailed bio-data in respect of each of the persons proposed.
The bio-data should, among other things, include the postings during the last ten
years before superannuation of the persons proposed as IEMs, in case the names
relate to persons having worked in the government sector.
The bio-data should also include details regarding experience older than ten years
before superannuation of the persons proposed as IEMs, if they have relevant
domain experience in the activities of PSUs where they are considered as IEMs.
(Ref: 008/VGL/001 Dtd 19.05.2008)

3.

Use of Brand Names in NIT
It has come to the notice of the Commission that some departments / organisations
are issuing tenders for purchase of computers where they mention and insist on
international brands. This not only encourages the monopolistic practices but
also vitiates the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance, D/o Expenditure
vide its OM No. 8(4) - E.II (A) 98 dated 17.12.1998. It is therefore, advised that
departments / organisations may follow the instructions issued by the Department
of Expenditure. No.98/ORD/1 Dtd. 05.05.2003. (Ref: No.8 (4)-E.II (A)/98 Dtd.
17.12.1998)

Measures to curb the menace of counterfeit and refurbished IT products
To insist on undertaking from OEM that all the components / parts / assembly
/ software used in the Desktop and Server are original / new components and
that not refurbished / duplicate / second hand components / parts / assembly /
software are being used or would have been used. (Ref: No.007/CRD/008 Dtd.
15.02.2008)

5.

Tender Sample Clause

a.

While it is recognized that samples may be required to be approved to provide
a basis in respect of indeterminable parameters such as shade, feel, finish &
workmanship for supplies of such items but system of approving / rejecting tender
samples at the time of decision making is too subjective and is not considered
suitable, especially for items which have detailed specifications. The lack of
competition in such cases is also likely to result in award of contracts at high rates.

b.

It is thus advised that Government Departments / Organizations should consider
procurement of such items on the basis of detailed specifications. If required,
provision for submission of an advance sample by successful bidder(s) may be
stipulated for indeterminable parameters such as, shade/tone, size, make-up, feel,
finish and workmanship, before giving clearance for bulk production of the supply.
Such a system would not only avoid subjectivity at the tender decision stage
but would also ensure healthy competition among bidders and thus take care of
quality aspect as well as reasonableness of Prices. (Ref: No. 2EE-1-CTE-3 Dtd.
15.10.2003).

6.

Turnkey Contracts
The Commission has been receiving complaints that in turnkey contracts for
networking of computer systems a lot of unrelated products are being included
in the contracts which are either not required or which are stand alone in nature
and can be procured separately at much lower cost. Inclusion of these unrelated
items creates opportunities for malpractices. The Commission is of the view that
wherever possible it will be advisable to take an independent third party view about
the scope of turnkey projects so that the tendency to include unrelated products as
part of the turnkey project is avoided. (Ref: 004/ORD/8 Dtd. 03.11.2004)

7.

Design Mix Concrete
Provisions of IS 456:2000 are to be complied with. (Ref: 010/VGL/066 Dtd.
07.10.2010)

8.

Use of products with standard specifications
It is reiterated that the items with standard specifications only should be stipulated
in the bid documents. In case, items with non-standard specifications are to be
procured, reasoning for procuring such items may be recorded and reasonability
of rates must be checked before placing order. (Ref : 98-VGL-25 Dtd. 26.04.2007)

14

9.

Expression of Interest (EOI)

a.

There have been instances where the equipment / plant to be procured is of
complex nature and the procuring organisation may not possess the full knowledge
of the various technical solutions available in the market to meet the desired
objectives of the transparent procurement that ensures value for money spent
simultaneously ensuring up-gradation of technology & capacity building.

b.

It would be prudent to invite Expression of Interest and proceed to finalise
specifications based on technical discussions / presentations with the experience
manufacturers / suppliers in a transparent manner. In such cases, two stage
tendering process may be useful and may be preferred. During the first stage
of tendering, acceptable technical solutions can be evaluated after calling for
EOI from the leading experienced and knowledgeable manufacturers / suppliers
in the field of the proposed procurement. Once the technical specifications and
evaluation criteria are finalised, the second stage of tendering could consist of
calling for techno-commercial bids as per the usual tendering system under single
bid or two bid system as per the requirement of each case. (Ref: 011/VGL/014
Dtd. 11.02.2011).

10. Transparency in Tendering System
In order to maintain transparency and fairness, it would be appropriate organisations
should evolve a practice of finalizing the acceptability of the bidding firms in
respect of qualifying criteria before or during technical negotiations with Tenderer.
Obtaining revised price bids from the firms, which do not meet the qualification
criteria, would be incorrect. Therefore, the exercise of short listing of the qualifying
firms must be completed prior to seeking the revised price bids. Moreover, the
intimation of rejection to the firms whose bids have been evaluated but found not
meeting the qualification criteria, along with the return of the unopened price bid,
will enhance transparency and plug the loopholes in the Tendering System. All
organisations/departments are advised to frame a policy accordingly. (Ref: 004/
ORD/9 Dtd. 10.12.2004).
11. Time bound Processing of Procurement.
a.

The Commission has observed that at times, the processing of tenders is
inordinately delayed which may result in time and cost overruns and also invite
criticism from the Trade Sector.

b.

It is, therefore, essential that tenders are finalized and contracts are awarded in
a time bound manner within original validity of the tender, without seeking further
extension of validity. While a short validity period calls for prompt finalization
by observing specific timeline for processing, a longer validity period has the
disadvantage of vendors loading their offers in anticipation of likely increase in
costs during the period. Hence, it is important to fix the period of validity with
utmost care. (Ref : 008/VGL/083 Dtd. 06.11.2008).

II. TENDER STAGE
12. Notice Inviting Tenders
The Commission has observed that some of the Notice Inviting Tenders (NITs)
have a clause that the tender applications could be rejected without assigning any
reason. This clause is apparently incorporated in tender enquiries to safeguard
15

the interest of the organisation in exceptional circumstances and to avoid any
legal dispute. The Commission has discussed the issue and it is emphasized that
the above clause in the bid document does not mean that the tender accepting
authority is free to take decision in an arbitrary manner. He is bound to record
clear, logical reasons for any such action of rejection / recall of tenders on the file
(Ref No OFF-1-CTE-1(Pt) V Dtd 24.03.2005).
13. Receipt and Opening of Tenders
In general, the receipt of tenders should be through tender boxes as suggested in
our booklets. However, in cases where the tenders are required to be submitted
by hand, it may be ensured that the name and designation of at least two officers
are mentioned in the bid documents. The information about these officers should
also be displayed at the entrance / reception of the premises where tenders are
to be deposited so as to ensure convenient approach for the bidders. The tenders
after receipt should be opened on the stipulated date and time in presence of the
intending bidders. (Ref: No. 05-04-1-CTE-8 Dtd. 08.06.2004).
14. Improving Vigilance Administration-Tenders
Some organisations have been using the Public Sector as a shield or a conduit
for getting costly inputs or for improper purchases. This also should be avoided.
Another issue that has been raised is that many a time the quantity to be ordered
is much more than that L1 alone can supply. In such cases the quantity order may
be distributed in such a manner that the purchase is done in a fair, transparent and
equitable manner. (Ref: 98/ORD/1 Dtd. 15.03.1999).
15. Agents:
a.

In a tender, either the Indian agent on behalf of the Principal / OEM or Principal /
OEM itself can bid but both cannot bid simultaneously for the same item/ product
in the same tender.

b.

If an agent submits bid on behalf of the Principal / OEM, the same agent shall not
submit a bid on behalf of another Principal / OEM in the same tender for the same
item / product.
Tender conditions may be carefully prepared keeping in view of above guidelines.
(Ref: 12-02-06-CTE/SPI (1)-2/161730 Dtd.13.01.2012).

16. Contracts Awarded on Nomination basis
a.

16

In the circumstances, if sometimes award of contract on nomination basis by the
PSUs become inevitable, the Commission strongly feels that the following points
should be strictly observed:
i.

All works awarded on nomination basis should be brought to the notice of the
Board of the respective PSUs for scrutiny and vetting post facto.

ii.

The reports relating to such awards will be submitted to the Board every
quarter.

iii.

The audit committee may be required to check at least 10% of such cases
(Ref: No.005/CRD/19 Dtd. 09.05.2006).

b.

It is needless to state that tendering process or public auction is a basic requirement
for the award of contract by any Government agency as any other method,
especially award of contract on nomination basis, would amount to a breach of
Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing right to equality, which implies right to
equality to all interested parties.

c.

A relevant extract from the recent Supreme Court of India judgement in the case of
Nagar Nigam, Meerut Vs. A1 Faheem Meat Export Pvt. Ltd.[arising out of SLP(civil)
No.10174 of 2006] is reproduced below to reinforce this point (refer circular cited
below). The Commission advises all CVOs to formally apprise their respective
Boards / Management of the above observations as well as the full judgement
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court for necessary observance. (Ref: No.005/CRD/19
Dtd. 05.07.2007).
All works awarded on nomination basis should be brought to the notice of the Board
of the respective PSUs for information. (Ref: 005/CRD/19 (Part) Dtd.19.05.2010)

d.

The Commission has been emphasising on the need for observing integrity,
transparency, fairness and equity in all aspects of decision making including
in tendering and award of contracts. In view of the complaints being received
regarding award of contracts on ‘nomination basis’ without adequate justification,
the Commission has decided to reiterate their earlier instructions for strict
implementation. Further, the Commission directs that details of all tenders awarded
on nomination basis shall be posted on the website in the public domain as per
Commission’s Office Order of 5th July 2007 along with brief reasons for doing so.

e.

The Commission has observed that there have been instances where government
organisations / PSUs obtain contract from other government organisations / PSUs
and further award the same to private entities on ‘back to back tie up’ basis without
competitive tendering mechanism and without any significant value addition
by the procuring government organisation / PSU. Their practice subverts the
Commission’s emphasis on integrity, transparency, fairness and equity in decision
making. (Ref No 005/CRD/19/196756 Dtd. 11.07.2012)

17. Grant of Mobilization Advance
a.

Adequate steps may be taken to ensure stipulation of mobilization advance only
for selected works and advance should be interest bearing so that contractor does
not draw undue benefit. Timely execution/completion of all projects is an essential
requirement and the contractor would like to draw interest bearing mobilization
advance only when he needs to maintain his cash flow. (Ref: No. UU/POL/19 Dtd.
08.10.1997)

b.

Provision of mobilization advance should essentially be need-based. Decision
to provide such advance should rest at the level of Board (with concurrence of

17

Finance) in the organization in respect of interest free advance. However, in case
of interest bearing advance, organisation may delegate powers at appropriate
levels such as CMD or Functional Directors. (Ref: 4CC-1-CTE-2 Dtd. 05.02.2008).
c.

Though the Commission does not encourage interest free mobilization advance,
if the Management feels its necessity in specific cases, then it should be clearly
stipulated in the Tender document and its recovery should be time-based and not
linked with progress of work. This would ensure that even if the contractor is not
executing the work or executing it at a slow pace, the recovery of advance could
commence and scope for misuse of such advance could be reduced.

d.

Mobilization advance should be released only against furnishing of Bank Guarantee
(BG). Recovery of such advance could be ensured by encashing the BG for the
work supposed to be completed within a particular period of time.

e.

There should be a clear stipulation of interest to the charged on delayed recoveries
either due to the late submission of bill by the contractor or any other reason
besides the reason giving rise to the encashment of BG, as stated above.

f.

The amount of mobilization advance; interest to be charged, if any; its recovery
schedule and any other relevant detail should be explicitly stipulated in the
tendered document upfront.

g.

Relevant format for BG should be provided in the tender document.

h.

Authenticity of such BGs should also be invariably verified from the issuing bank,
confidentially and independently by the organization.

i.

In case of ‘Machinery and Equipment advance’, insurance and hypothecation to
the employer should be ensured.

j.

Utilization certificate from the contractor for the mobilization advance should be
obtained. Preferably, mobilization advance should be given in instalments and
subsequent instalments should be released after getting satisfactory utilization
certificate from the contractor for the earlier instalment. (Ref No.4CC-1-CTE-2
Dtd. 10.04.2007).

k.

BG etc., taken towards security of advance should be at least 110% of the advance so
as to enable recovery of not only principal amount but also interest portion, if required.

l.

The advance should not be paid in less than two instalments except in special
circumstances for the reasons to be recorded. This will keep check on contractor
misusing the full utilisation advance when the work is delayed considerably.
A clause in the tender enquiry and the contract of cases providing for interest free
mobilisation advances may be stipulated that if the contract is terminated due to
default by the Contractor, the mobilisation advance would be deemed as interest
bearing advance at the interest rate of ____% (to be stipulated depending on the
prevailing rate at the time of issue of NIT) to be compounded quarterly. (Ref:
01-11-CTE-SH-100 Dtd. 17.02.2011)

18

18. Post Tender Negotiation
a.

The Commission has banned post-tender negotiations except with L-1 vide its
instruction No.8 (1) (h)/98(1) dated 18/11/98. This instruction pertains to the award
of work / supply orders etc., where the Government or the Government Company
has to make payment.

b.

If the tender is for sale of material by the Government or the Government company,
the post-tender negotiations are not to be held except with H-1 (i.e. the highest
tenderer), if required. (Ref: 98/ORD/1 Dtd 03.08.2001).

c.

There should not be any negotiations. Negotiations if at all shall be an exception
and only in the case of proprietary items or in the case of items with limited source
of supply. Negotiations shall be held with L-1 only. Counter offers tantamount to
negotiations and should be treated at par with negotiation.
Negotiations can be recommended in exceptional circumstances only after due
application of mind and recording valid, logical reasons justifying negotiations.
In case of inability to obtain the desired results by way of education in rates
and negotiations prove infructuous, satisfactory explanations are required to be
recorded by the Committee who recommended the negotiations. The Committee
shall be responsible for lack of application of mind in case its negotiations have
only unnecessarily delayed the award of work / contract.
Further, it has been observed by the Commission that at times the Competent
Authority takes unduly long time to exercise the power of accepting the tender
or negotiate or re-tender. Accordingly, the model time frame for according such
approval to completion of the entire process of Award of tenders should not exceed
one month from the date of submission of recommendations. In case the file has
to be approved at the next higher level, a maximum of 15 days may be added for
clearance at each level. The overall time frame should be within the validity period
of the tender/contract. In case of L-1 backing out there should be re-tendering as
per extant instructions. (Ref: 005/ORD/12 Dtd. 25.10.2005).

d.

Post tender negotiations could often be a source of corruption, it is directed that
there should be no post-tender negotiations with L-1, except in certain exceptional
situations. Such exceptional situations would include procurement of proprietary
items, items with limited sources of supply and items where there is suspicion of a
cartel formation. The justification and details of such negotiations should be duly
recorded and documented without any loss of time.

e.

In cases where a decision is taken to go for re-tendering due to the unreasonableness
of the quoted rates, but the requirements are urgent and a re-tender for the entire
requirement would delay the availability of the item, thus jeopardizing the essential
operations, maintenance and safety, negotiations would be permitted with L-1
bidder(s) for the supply of a bare minimum quantity. The balance quantity should,
however, be procured expeditiously through a re-tender, following the normal
tendering process.

f.

Competent Authority should exercise Due Diligence while accepting a tender
19

or ordering negotiations or calling for a re-tender. In no case should the overall
time frame exceed the validity period of the tender and it should be ensured that
tenders are invariably finalised within their validity period.
g.

Quantity to be ordered is far more than what L-1 alone is capable of supplying and
there was no prior decision to split the quantities, then the quantity being finally
ordered should be distributed among the other bidders in a manner that is fair,
transparent and equitable.

h.

It is essentially in cases where the organisations decide in advance to have
more than one source of supply (due to critical or vital nature of the item), the
Commission insists on pre-disclosing the ratio of splitting the supply in the tender
itself.

i.

Counter-offers to L-1, in order to arrive at an acceptable price, shall amount to
negotiations. However, any counter-offer thereafter to L-2, L-3, etc., (at the rates
accepted by L-1) in case of splitting of quantities, as pre-disclosed in the tender,
shall not be deemed to be a negotiation. (Ref: No.005/CRD/012 Dtd. 03.03.2007
& 005/CRD/012 Dtd. 20.01.2010).
Commissions’ guideline would not be applicable in Projects funded by World
Bank, ADB, etc., if found to be in conflict with the applicable procurement rules of
the funding agencies. (Ref: No.98/ORD/001 Dtd. 28.10.2011& No.3 (V)/99/9 Dtd.
01.10.1999).

j.

Reference is invited to Commission’s instructions of even number dated
25.10.2005 on the above subject. A number of references have been received in
the Commission, asking for clarification on issues pertaining to specific situations.
The Commission’s guidelines were framed with a view to ensuring fair and
transparent purchase procedure in the organizations. The guidelines are quite
clear and it is for the organizations to take appropriate decision, keeping these
guidelines in view. In case they want to take action in deviation or modification
of the guidelines, to suit their requirements, it is for them to do so by recording
the reasons and obtaining the approval of the competent authority for the same.
However, in no case, should there be any compromise to transparency, equity
or fair treatment to all the participants in a tender. (Ref: 005/CRD/12 Dtd. 03.10.
2006).

19. Use of Website in Government Procurement or Tender Process.
a.

20

In addition to the existing rules and practices regarding giving publicity of tenders
through newspapers, trade journals and providing tender documents manually
and through post etc., the complete bid documents along with application form
shall be published on the website of the organization. It shall be ensured by the
concerned organization that the parties making use of this facility of website are
not asked again to obtain some other related documents from the Department
manually for purpose of participating in the Tender Process i.e. all documents up
to date should remain available and shall be equally legally valid for participation in

the Tender Process as manual documents obtained from the Department through
manual process.
b.

The concerned organization must give its web site address in the advertisement /
NIT published in the newspapers.

c.

If the concerned organization wishes to charge for the application form downloaded
from the computer then they may ask the bidding party to pay the amount by draft /
cheques etc. at the time of submission of the application form and bid documents.

d.

While the above directions must be fully complied with, efforts should be made
by organizations to eventually switch over to the process of e-procurement /
e-sale wherever it is found to be feasible and practical. (Ref: No.98/ORD/1 Dtd.
18.12.2003).

e.

The Commission has issued a Directive vide No. 98/ORD/1 Dtd 18.12.2003 wherein
detailed instructions are issued regarding the use of website for tendering process.
The objective is to improve vigilance administration by increasing transparency.
The instructions were to take effect from 1st January 2004. It is noticed that many
organisations whose websites are functional are still not putting their tenders on
the website. The Commission has desired that CVOs should ensure compliance of
the above directive. They should regularly pursue the newspaper advertisements,
the website of their organisation and in general keep track to ensure that the
directives of the Commission on this subject are complied with. Further, the
Commission has desired that the CVOs should indicate in their monthly report in
the column pertaining to Tender Notices whether all the tenders have been put on
the website, and if not, the reasons for non-compliance. The explanation of the
concerned officers who are not complying with these directions should be called
and further necessary action taken. (Ref: 98/ORD/1 Dtd 05.02.2004).

f.

In CPWD, MCD, Civil Construction Division of Post & Telecom Departments and
in many other departments/organizations, there is system of short-term Tenders
(by whatever name it is called in different organizations), wherein works below a
particular value are undertaken without resorting to publicity as is required in the
open tenders. This practice is understandable because of cost and time involved
in organizing publicity through newspapers. In all such cases, notice can be put
on the web-site of the department as it does not take any time compared to giving
advertisements in the newspapers and it practically does not cost anything. This
will benefit the department by bringing in transparency and reducing opportunities
for abuse of power. This will also help the organizations by bringing in more
competition.
In view of the reasons given above, the Commission has decided that instructions
given in the Commission’s circular (No. 98/ORD/1 dated 18.12.2003) for the use
of web-site will also apply to all such works awarded by the department/PSEs/
other organizations over which the Commission has jurisdiction. (Ref: 98/ORD/1
Dtd 11.02.2004).

g.

It is clarified that Commission’s instructions are with regard to goods, services and
works procured through open tender system, so these instructions do not apply to
21

proprietary items and items which necessarily need to be procured through OEMs
and OESs (Original equipment Suppliers).
h.

In many organizations goods, services and works which as per laid down norms
are to be procured / executed through open tender system many times due to
urgency are done through short term tenders without resorting to wide publicity in
newspapers because of time constraint. In all such cases short term tenders (by
whatever name it is called) etc. should also be put on the website of the dept. as
it does not involve any additional time or cost.

i.

Periodic Updating of Vendor Directory:
The Commission desires that in all such cases there should be wide publicity
through the web site as well as through the other traditional channels at regular
intervals for registration of contractors / suppliers. All the required proforma for
registration, the pre-qualification criteria etc. should be always available on the
website of the organization and it should be possible to download the same and
apply to the organization. There should not be any entry barriers or long gaps in
the registration of suppliers / contractors. The intervals on which publicity is to be
given through website and traditional means can be decided by each organization
based on their own requirements and developments in the market conditions. It
is expected that it should be done at least once in a year for upgrading the list of
registered vendors / contractors.

j.

Opportunity to all registered Vendors in Limited Tendering:
The concerned organisation should give web - based publicity for Limited Tenders
also except for items of minor value. If the organization desires to limit the access
of the Limited Tender documents to only registered contractors / suppliers, they
can limit the access by issuing passwords to all registered contractors / suppliers.
But it should be ensured that password access is given to all the registered
contractors / suppliers and not denied to any of the registered suppliers. Any
denial of password to a registered supplier / contractor will lead to presumption of
malafide intention on the part of the Tendering Authority. (Ref: No.98/0RD/1 Dtd.
02.07.2004).

k.

All organisations must post a summary every month of all the contracts/purchases
made above a certain threshold-value, to be decided by the CVO in consultation
with the Head of organisation i.e. CEO / CMD etc. as per Annexure-I enclosed to
the Circular cited below. The threshold-value may be reported to the Commission
for concurrence. (Ref: No.005/VGL/4 Dtd 16.03.2005).

l.

The threshold limits as proposed by the CVOs in consultation with CEOs can be
taken as the starting point which could be revised subsequently to cover 60% of
the transactions in a year and further 100% on stabilization. (Ref: No.005/VGL/4
Dtd 20.09.2005)

m. CVOs are, therefore, once again advised to ensure that details of the tenders
awarded above the threshold value by the organizations are uploaded in time on
the organisation’s official website and are updated every month. CVOs should
22

also specifically bring to the notice of the Commission, any violation of this order.
(Ref: No.005/VGL/4 Dtd. 01.09.2006)
n.

The Commission, therefore, while reiterating its aforementioned instructions
directs the CVOs to convey to the Commission the following information latest by
30/4/07:-

i.

The threshold value decided by the organization for publishing on their website,
details of award of tenders/contracts;

ii.

The extent to which the details of awarded tenders are being posted on the website
and whether the websites are being updated regularly or not;

iii.

Whether first/second phase of the Commission’s circular dated 22/11/06 has been
implemented or not;

iv.

If not, the reasons thereof: steps being taken by the organization to ensure
implementation of the Commission’s circular and the exact date by which both the
phases as mentioned in the Commission’s circular would be fully implemented;.
Any failure on the part of organization to implement the directions contained in
the Commissions circulars as mentioned above would be viewed seriously by the
Commission. (Ref: No. 006/VGL/117 Dtd. 18.04.2007).

o.

To post summary of details of contracts/purchases awarded so as to cover 75%
of the value of the transactions without any further delay. Any failure on the part of
the organisations on this account would be viewed seriously by the Commission.
All Chief Vigilance Officers should reflect the compliance status in their monthly
reports to the Commission after personally verifying the same. (Ref: No.005/
VGL/4 Dtd 14.07.2009).

20. Leveraging Technology
a.

All Govt. Organisations discharging regulatory / enforcement functions or service
delivery of any kind, which cause interface with the general public / private
businesses, etc., shall provide complete information on their websites regarding
the laws, rules and procedures governing the issue of licenses, permissions,
clearances, etc. An illustrative list is given in the annexure to this Circular.

b.

In case of Contracts & Procurement:
i.

Applications for registration of contractors/suppliers/consultants/vendors,
etc.

ii.

Status of all bill payments to contractors / suppliers, etc.

c.

All application forms / proforma should be made available on the websites in
a downloadable form. If the organisation concerned wishes to charge for the
application form downloaded from the computer, the same may be done at the
time of the submission of the application forms.

d.

In the second stage, the status of individual applications / matters should be made
available on the organisation’s website and should be updated from time-to-time
23

so that the applicants remain duly informed about the status of their applications.
In addition to the manual receipt of applications, all organisations should examine
the feasibility of online receipt of applications and, wherever feasible, a timeframe
for introducing the facility should be worked out. As a large number of Govt.
organisations are opting for e-governance, they may consider integrating the
above mentioned measures into their business processes so that duplication is
avoided. (Ref: No.006/VGL/117 Dtd. 22.11.2006).
21. E-Tendering / E-Procurement
a.

The Commission has been receiving a number of references from different
departments/organisations asking for a uniform policy in this matter. The
departments / organisations may themselves decide on e-procurement/reverse
auction for purchases or sales and work out the detailed procedure in this regard.
It is, however, to be ensured that the entire process is conducted in a transparent
and fair manner. (Ref: No.98/ORD/1 Dtd. 11.09.2003).

b.

Guidelines on security related issues in e-tendering systems. (Ref: No.009/
VGL/002 Dtd 17.09.2009).

c.

Checklist for implementation of e-tendering solutions. (Ref: No.009/VGL/002 Dtd.
26.04.2010).

d.

In order to ensure proper security of the e-procurement system all departments /
organisations are advised to get their system certified by Department of Information
Technology (DIT). (Ref: No.010/VGL/035 Dtd. 23.06.2010).

e.

DIT in turn requested its attached STQC (Standardisation, Testing and Quality
Certificate) Directorate to establish necessary processes and systems to enable
certifications of e-procurement systems. Accordingly, the guidelines prepared
by STQC in this regard approved and notified by the DIT is available on e-Gov.
standards website (www.egovstandards.gov.in). The guidelines are also available
on Commission’s website. All the Ministries / Departments / Organisations are
advised to use these guidelines for compliance to Quality Requirements for
certifying the e-procurement systems. (Ref: No.010/VGL/035/161731 Dtd.
12.01.2012).

f.

All organisations should invariably follow a fair, transparent and open tendering
procedure to select the application service provider for implementing their
e-tendering solutions. The standard guidelines on tendering procedure should
hold good for the procurement of these services as well. (Ref: 009/VGL/002 Dtd.
13.01.2009).

III. CONTRACT AWARD / ORDER EXECUTION STAGE /
CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION STAGE
22. E-Payments
a.
24

The payment to all suppliers / vendors, refunds of various nature, and other

payments which the organisations routinely make shall be made through electronic
payment mechanism at all centres where such facilities are available in the banks.
Salary and other payments to the employees of the concerned organisations
at such centres shall also be made through electronic clearing system (ECS)
wherever such facilities exist. As the organisations will have to collect bank
account numbers from the vendor, suppliers, employees and others who have
interface of this nature with the Govt. organisations, the concerned organisations
may plan to switch over to e-payment system in a phased manner starting with
transactions with the major suppliers in the beginning or in whatever manner is
found more convenient. (Ref No.98/ORD/1 Dtd. 08.04.2004).
b.

The Commission had directed that by July 2004, 50% of the payment transactions
both in value terms as well as in number of transactions shall be made through
ECS/EFT mechanism instead of payments through Cheques; and urged all Banks,
PSUs and Departments to provide an enabling environment and facilities so that
such an initiative is successful. (Ref: No. 98/ORD/1 Dtd. 20.10.2004)

23. Delays in Payments to Contractors &Suppliers etc. Reducing opportunities
for corruption reg.
The Commission has directed that all the CVOs should undertake a review of bills
received during the last six months. The review is meant to primarily determine the
time taken in clearing the bills. It is suggested that the cut off limit for bills can be
Rs. 1 lakh i.e. time taken for payment of all bills above this amount should be seen.
In smaller organisations the cut off limit can be lower depending on feasibility and
convenience. The CVO should also review whether payments are being made on
“first-come-first-serve” basis or not. (Ref: No. 005/ORD/1 Dtd. 10.03.2005)
24. Selection and Employment of Consultants
a.

Conflicts of Interest: A firm which has been engaged by the PSU to provide goods
or works for a Project and any of its affiliates will be disqualified from providing
Consulting Services for the same Project. Conversely, a firm hired to provide
Consulting Services for the preparation or implementation of a Project, and any
of its affiliates, will be disqualified from subsequently providing goods or works or
services related to the initial assignment for the same Project.

b.

Consultants or any or their affiliates will not be hired for any assignment, which by
its nature, may be in conflict with another assignment of the consultants. (No.98/
DSP/3 Dtd. 24.12.2004)

c.

The Commission has declared that following guidelines be kept in view while
finalising the contracts for engaging Consultants:i.

Conflicts of Interest:

I.

Conflict between consulting activities and procurement of goods, works or
non-consulting services

II.

Conflict among consulting assignments

III.

Relationship with employer’s staff
25

IV.

A consultant shall submit only one proposal. If participates in more than one
proposal, all such proposals shall be disqualified.

ii.

Professional Liability:
The Consultant is expected to carry out its assignments with due diligence
and in accordance with prevailing standards of the profession. As the
Consultant’s liability to the employer will be governed by the applicable
law, the contract need not deal with the matter. The Client (purchaser) may,
however, prescribe other liabilities depending on the requirement in each
case without any restriction on the Consultant’s liability as per the applicable
law. (Ref: 011/VGL/063 Dtd. 24.06.2011)

d.

Some of the common irregularities / lapses observed have been narrated in the
Circular. No OFF 1 CTE 1 Dtd. 25.11.2002. (http://www.cvc.nic.in/three.pdf)

25. Acceptance of Bank Guarantee (BG)
a.

Copy of proper prescribed format on which BGs are accepted from the contracts
should be enclosed with the Tender Document and it should be verified verbatim
on receipt with original document.

b.

It should be insisted upon the contractors, suppliers etc. that BGs to be submitted
by them should be sent to the organisation directly by the issuing bank under
Registered Post (A.D.).

c.

In exceptional cases, where the BGs are received through the contractors,
suppliers etc., the issuing branch should be requested to immediately send by
Registered Post (A.D) an unstamped duplicate copy of the Guarantee directly
to the organisation with a covering letter to compare with the original BGs and
confirm that it is in order.

d.

As an additional measure of abundant precaution, all BGs should be independently
verified by the organisations. In the organisation / unit, one officer should be
specifically designated with responsibility for i) verification, ii) timely renewal and
iii) timely encashment of BGs. (Ref: No.02-07-01-CTE-30 Dtd. 31.12.2007).

26. If L-1 Party backs out
If L-1 Party backs out, there should be re-tendering in a transparent and fair
manner. The authority may in such a situation call for Limited or Short Notice
Tender if so justified in the interest of work and take a decision on the basis of
lowest tender. (Ref: No.98/ORD/1 Dtd 24.08.2000).
27. Back to Back tie-up by PSUs
a.

26

It has been observed during intensive examination of various works / contracts
awarded by construction PSUs on back to back basis that the works are being
awarded in an adhoc and arbitrary manner without inviting tenders and ascertaining
the performance, capability and experience of the tenderers. In some cases,
the works were awarded on single tender basis / limited tender basis though
sufficient time was available with the organisation to invite open tenders. (Note:

Observations of the Commission are listed in the circular mentioned below)
(Ref: No.06-03-02-CTE-34 Dtd. 20.10.2003)
b.

The Commission has observed that there have been instances where Government
Organisations / PSUs obtain contract from other Government Organisations
/ PSUs and further award the same to private entities on ‘back to back tie up’
basis without competitive tendering mechanism and without any significant value
addition by the procuring Government Organisation / PSU. Their practice subverts
the Commission’s emphasis on integrity, transparency, fairness and equity in
decision making. (Ref No 005/CRD/19/196756 Dtd. 11th Dec 2012)

28. Out of turn Allotments / Discretion:
The details of all such cases regarding tenders or out of turn allotments or
discretion exercised in favour of an employee / party to be published on the Notice
Board and in the organisation’s regular publication(s), (Ref: No.005/VGL/4 Dtd
the 16.03.2005)
29. Banning of Business Dealings
The Commission once again reiterates its instructions that banning of business
is an administrative matter to be decided by the management of the organization
and the CVC does not give its advice in such matters. (F.No. 000/VGL/161 Dtd.
the 24.03.2005)
30. Undertaking by the Members of Tender Committee / Agency.
In continuation of the Commission’s directions vide Order 005/VGL/4 dated
16/3/2005 regarding transparency in the tender process, the Commission would
advise that the members of the Tender Committee should give an undertaking at
the appropriate time, that none of them has any personal interest in the Companies
/ Agencies participating in the Tender Process. Any Member having interest in any
Company should refrain from participating in the Tender Committee. (Ref: 005/
VGL/66 Dtd the 9/12/2005)
31. Recoveries arising out of Intensive Examination conducted by CTEO
The observations / advice of the Commission are required to be considered
by the executing agencies in terms of the Contract and recoveries are to be
enforced as admissible as per the conditions of the Contract. (Ref: TE (NH)/2011/
Recoveries/144262 Dtd. 12.09.2011)

with quarry spills, stone chips etc. and the packing blinded with stone grit and watered and
consolidated by log hammer.
Rubble packing in road work shall be thoroughly consolidated by means of power roller or 9
ton capacity instead of log hammer and the surface shall be brought to proper graded and
camber. After checking the level, grade and camber, the surface will again be watered and
rolled to receive road structure.
Leveling course: It shall be either plain cement concrete of Leaner mix or lime concrete
which shall be proportioned as stipulated in the relevant item and mixed and placed in
position conforming to line and level shown in the drawing and compacted by approved
means and cured adequately.

Lime concrete shall be prepared by mixing sand and slaked lime in proportion of three parts
of sand and one parts of lime and ground in suitable mill and the mortar so prepared shall be
added to six parts of brickbat passing through 50 mm. mesh, mixed well and placed in
position and compacted by approved means. The concrete shall be cured adequately.
PLAIN & REINFORCED CEMENT CONCRETE:
General: Except where they are varied by the requirements of this specifications due to
provision of Indian Standard Specification IS: 456 -1978 for plain and reinforced concrete
and IS: 432 Part I and II for mild and medium tensile steel bars and hard drawn steel wire for
concrete reinforcement and any other relevant ISS applicable together with the latest
amendments shall be held to be incorporated in this specification. It shall be intent of these
specifications to ensure that all concrete placed at various locations of the job should be
durable, strong enough to carry the design load, it should wear well and practically be
impervious to water. It should be free from such defects as shrinkage, cracking and
honeycombing.
Proportioning the Mix : In ordinary concrete, excluding controlled concrete proportions of
cement to fine and coarse aggregate shall be as specified in the respective items and shall be
accurately measured. The proportions are based on assumption that the aggregates are dry. If
aggregates are moist, allowance shall be made for bulking in accordance with IS: 2386 (Part
II). Allowance3 shall also be made for surface water present in aggregates when computing
water surface present shall be determined by one of the field methods described IS: 2386 (Part
III).
Mixing : Normally Concrete of 1 :2: 4 or richer mix shall be mixed in an approved
mechanical mixer. In concreting of smaller quantities hand mixing may be allowed provided
10% extra cement is used as per IS 456. The mixer and the mixing platform shall be suitably
protected from wind and rain. Aggregates shall be accurately measured out in boxes and
mixed dry along with cement, water shall then be added in measured quantity and mixing
Page 48 of 95

shall be continued until there is a uniform in colour and consistency but in no case shall the
mixing be done for less than 2 minutes.
Consistency : Quantity of water for making reinforced concrete shall be sufficient, so as to
ensure that concrete shall surround and properly grip all the reinforcement. The best
consistency shall be that which will flow sluggishly without flattening out and without
separation of coarse aggregates from the mortar. The degree of plasticity shall depend on the
nature of work and atmospheric temperature and whether the concrete is vibrated or hand
compacted. The slumps shown in Table B obtained by the standard slump test carried out in
accordance with the procedure laid down in ISS : 1199- 1959 Shall be adopted for different
types of work.
Admixtures : The use of admixture may be allowed only if approved by the Architect and his
decision in this regard shall be final.
Transporting : Concrete shall be conveyed from the place of mixing to the place of final
deposit as rapidly as practicable by methods, which will prevent segregation or loss of any of
the ingredients. If segregation does occur during transport, the concrete shall be re-mixed
before being placed. In no case, more than 30 minutes shall clasp between mixing and
consolidation in its position.
Placing & Compacting : Concrete shall be placed in layers of suitable thickness or in stripes
and compacted before initial setting commences and should not be subsequently disturbed.
Method of placing shall be such as to preclude segregation and as far as practicable the
placing shall be continuous. Special care shall be taken in accordance with IS: 456 while
laying concrete under extreme weather.
Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted during the operation of placing and thoroughly
worked around the reinforcement, embedded fixtures and spaded, against corners of the form
work and by punning, ridding, mechanically vibrating or by any other approved means. In
addition formwork shall be tapped lightly by using wooden mallet at the pouring head. The
number and type of vibrator to be used shall be subject to the approval of Architects and in
general immersion type vibrators shall be used. External vibrators shall also be used
whenever directed.
The intensity and duration of vibration shall be sufficient to cause complete settlement and
compaction without any satisfaction of successive layers or separation of ingredient or
formation of laitance. Vibrator. Shall be inserted vertically in the concrete at points not more
than 45 cm. apart and withdrawn very slowly when air bubbles no longer come on the
surface. Excessive vibration or vibration of very wet mixes is harmful and should be avoided.
Care shall be taken to utilize the vibrator only to compact the concrete and not to spread it.
Sufficient number of reserve vibrators in good working conditions shall be kept on hand at all
times, so as to ensure that there is no slackening or interruption in compacting.

continuously and day to day break in order to avoid unsightly patches at junctions. Whichever
punning is indicated, the interior plaster shall be finished rough. Otherwise the interior plaster
shall generally be finished to a smooth surface. The exterior surface shall generally be
finished with a wooden float. Wherever any special treatment to the plaster surface is
indicated, the work shall be done exactly as shown on the drawings, to the entire satisfaction
of the Engineer regarding the texture, colour and finish.
PEBBLE DASH FINISH
Mortar of required thickness consisting of one part cement and five parts of sand by volume
shall be applied to form a bass coat in the usual manner as described under plastering. While
Page 56 of 95

the mortar is still plastic. Small pebbles or crushed stone of size generally from 10 mm. as 20
mm. as approved by the Engineer shall be lightly tapped into the mortar with a wooden unit
float or the flat end of a trowel in order to ensure satisfactory bend between the dashing and
the mortar.
ROUGH CAST FINISH
The plaster shall be laid in two coats. The first coat shall consist of one part cement and five
parts of clean sharp sand. The thickness of first coat shall be just sufficient to fill up all
unevenness in the surface under treatment but shall not exceed 12 mm. the plaster shall be
laid by the throwing of mortar on the prepared surface with a trowel in a uniform layer and
pressed to form a good bend. The second coat shall not be smoothened. The second coat shall
consist of one part of cement, three parts of crushed stone of size 6 to 12 mm. or as approved
by the engineer. The thickness of the coat shall be 7 mm. to 8 mm. The cement and
aggregates shall be mixed dry in the proportion by volume as specified. Water shall be added
to form a plastic mix easily workable. The second coat shall be applied while the first coat is
still soft and plastic. The plastic mix shall be thrown on the first coat by means of a plaster’s
trowel and left in the rough condition. If it is desired to colour the surface, the colour may be
mixed with the second coat, in the proportion required by the Engineer to give the desired
things. As the colour fades on drying, a deeper shade than is desired shall be applied.
Alternatively coloured cement may be used.
SAND FACED
Plaster shall be applied in two coats consisting of an undercoat of cement mortar ( 1 :5 :12
mm. thick) and a finishing coat with cement mortar ( 1:3) 7 to 8 mm. thick. The sand used in
the finishing coat shall pass through 4.75 mm. sieve and be retained on 2.36-mm. sieves. Mix
should be formed on the surface of base coat by thoroughly combing it in many horizontal
lines about 12 mm. apart and 3 mm. deep when the mortar is still plastic. The surfaces of the
finishing coat shall be treated to obtain a uniform fine-grained texture with the help of
sponges, felt pads, etc. Care shall be taken to see that the cement used is of the same shade
throughout the work.

SCOPE
This specification shall include furnishing of all labour materials and equipment necessary to
complete the different types of flooring skirting and dadoing work as shown on drawings.
All works shall be carried out as per relevant Indian Standard Specifications and as directed
by Engineer. The rates shall include preparation of base, including chipping extra concrete,
roughening of surface and skin removed, cleaning, screening, leveling, etc.
PREPARATION OF BASE
The base concrete may be deposited in the whole area at a stretch. Before placing the concrete
the sub-base shall be properly wetted and well rammed. The concrete shall then be deposited
between the forms where necessary, thoroughly tamped and the surface finished level with
the top edges of the forms. The surface of base concrete shall be left rough to provide
adequate bend for the topping. Two or three hours after the concrete has been laid in position,
the surface shall be brushed with a hard brush to remove any scum or laitance and swept clean
so that coarse aggregate is exposed. When the topping is to be laid separately but directly ever
the structure/ suspended slab the surface of the structural/ suspended slab, 3 to 4 hours after
its laying, shall be thoroughly brushed with a coir or steel wire brush to remove any scum or
laitance and swept clean to expose the coarse aggregates and leave the surface rough.
A) IN SITU CEMENT CONCRETE FLOORING
Before the operation of laying the topping is started the surface of base concrete/ structural
slab shall be thoroughly cleaned of all dirt, loose, particle, caked mortar droppings by
scrubbing with coir or steel wire brush. Where the concrete is hardened so much that
roughening the surface by wire brush is not possible, the entire surface shall be roughened by
chipping or backing and the skin removed. The surface shall be thoroughly cleaned and
soaked with water, at least for twelve hours and the surplus water shall be removed by
mopping immediately before the topping immediately before the topping is laid in position.
a) The cement concrete floor, unless otherwise stated shall have a minimum thick of 25 mm.
The proportion of the mix shall be 1 part of cement, 2 parts of sand and 4 parts of stone
aggregate of Size 2.5 mm and below by volume.
b) Floor finish shall be divided into suitable panels so as to reduce the risk of cracking.
Generally no dimension of a panel shall exceed 2m. Length of a panel shall not exceed 1-2/3
times in breadth.
c) The joints in the floor finish shall extend through the borders and skirting. Construction joints
between boys of the floor finish should be placed every any joints in the base concrete.
Page 64 of 95

d) The aggregate and cement shall thoroughly and efficiently by mixed. Mixing shall be done
using a mechanical mixer. The concrete shall be as stiff as possible and amount of water
added shall be minimum necessary to give just sufficient plasticity for laying and compacting.
For improving the workability of the mix, thorough mixing rather than addition of

more

water shall be resorted to. The mix shall be used in the work within half-and-hour of the
addition of water for its preparation.
e) The screed strips shall be fixed on the base concrete dividing it into suitable panels as per
clause b). Before placing the concrete fix for topping, neat cement slurry shall be thoroughly
brushed into the prepared surface just ahead of the finish. The topping shall then by lain very
thoroughly tamp, struck off level and surface floated with a wooden float. The surface shall
be tested with the straight edge and mason’s spirit level to detect any inequalities in surface,
which, if any, shall be made good immediately.
f) The finish shall be laid in alternate panels, the intermediate panels being filled in after one or
two days depending upon the temperature and atmospheric conditions. The screed strips
should be removed the next day after the concrete has been deposited in the panels and the
edges of panels shall be examined for any honey combing or undulation which, if found, shall
be repaired straight and smooth by cement mortar; if the intermediate panels are not to be
filled the next day, the screed strips shall then be cleared and put back against the edge of
panels till the concrete in the alternate panels is to be deposited. When the concrete is being
deposited in the alternate panels the screed strips shall be removed. When the concrete is
being compacted in new panels, care shall be taken to avoid damage to the panels already
laid. When the concrete is being deposited in the alternate panels the screed strips shall be
removed. If glass or aluminum strips are provided for effective separation of panels, the
topping may be laid in all the panels simultaneously.
g) After the concrete has been fully compacted it shall be finished by traveling or flexing.
Finishing. Operations short shortly after the compaction of concrete and shall be spread over
the period of one to six hours depending upon the temperature and atmospheric conditions.
The surface shall be trowel led three times at intervals so as to produce a uniform and hard
surface. The time interval allowed between successive towelings is very important.
Immediately after laying, only just sufficient shall be done to give a level surface. Excessive
traveling in the earlier stages shall be avoided. Sometimes after the first toweling, the surface
beretowelled to close any process in the surface and scrap off any excess water in concrete
laitance (it shall not be toweled back into the topping). The final toweling shall be one well
before the concrete has become too hard but at such a time that considerable pressure is
required to make any impression on the surface. Toweling of a rich mix of dry cement and
fine aggregate on the surface shall not be permitted.

Page 65 of 95

h) When the topping is to be laid in two layers to obtain very smooth and dense finish, first
layer, over the base concrete, shall be laid as described in a), b), c) & d). But the mix
proportion of this under layer shall be one cement, three fine aggregate and six coarse stone
aggregate of size 12.5 mm and below by volume for a thickness of 25 mm. The surface of this
under layer shall be left rough after tamping it and leveling it with screed board. The top
wearing coat shall be 15 mm thick of concrete 1: 2 (One cement and two stone aggregate of
size 4.75 mm and below) by volume, of consistency stiffer than that of under laver shall then
be laid immediately and thoroughly tamped and finished in accordance with clauses (f), (g) &
(h)
i)

Immediately after the flooring surface is finished, it shall be protected from rapid drying
by erecting barriers against wind or draught and strong sunlight. As soon as the surface
has hardened sufficiently to prevent damage to.

ii) It shall be kept continuously moist for at least 15 days by means of wet gunny bags or
50mm thick damp sand spread over the surface or pooling water on the surface.
i)

Flooring shall be measured as laid in square meter correct to two pieces of decimal. For
length and breadth dimensions correct to a cm. laying skirting, dado or wall plaster shall be
taken. The thickness of the flooring shall be as specified in the schedule item and shall be
measured correct to 1 mm. No deductions shall be made or extra paid for any opening up to
0.1 sq.m. In area in the floor. Nothing extra will be paid for placing at different levels.
Flooring lay in borders. Margins, treads and risers of steps shall be measured under flooring
in respective of width. Expansion or other types of joints shall be measured separately
formwork for panels will not be measured separately.

B) FLOORING WITH CEMENT CONCRETE FLOORING TILES

Page 66 of 95

engineer, free of cost for approval and all subsequent supply shall conform to the respective
samples.
iii) The delivery of tiles shall be show arranged as to minimized handling, adequate precautions
should be taken to prevent accidental damaged to tiles while unloading. The tiles shall be
stored under cover to prevent exposure to dampness, sun, rain, or staining.
iv) The sub- floor shall be finished to a reasonable true plan surface by the thickness of the tiles
and the bed below the level of finished floor, properly graded and free from loose earth, dust
or dirt and lumps.
v) Before tiling working is started, all points of level for the finished tiles surface shall be
marked out. This is particularly necessary in the case of finished stair case landings and
wherever slopes in finished floor are desired, points of level and outlets shall be correctly
marked and outer opening made before hand.
vi) The bedding cement mortar shall consist of 1 part of port land cement and 6 parts of coarse
sand by volume thoroughly mixed in mechanical mixer. The quantity of water added shall be
the minimum necessary to give sufficient plasticity and work ability for laying.
vii) Before spreading the bedding, it is essential to ensure that the base is well compacted and the
surface is rough to form suitable key. The base shall be cleaned of all scum, laitance or plaster
droppings or any other loose foreign matter. It shall be properly wetted without allowing any
water pools on the surface. The mortar shall then be evenly spread over the base for two rows
of tiles and about 3 to 5 meters in length with thread level fixed at both the ends to act as a
guide. The top of mortar shall be kept rough so that cement slurry can be absorbed. The
thickness of the bedding shall normally be not less than 10mm and not more than 30 mm in
any one place, or as given I the schedule of Quantities. Immediately after, the laying of tiles
shall start as follows.
viii) Neat cement slurry of honey lime consistency shall be spread over the mortar be, over such
an area at a time as would accommodate about 20 tiles. The tiles shall be fixed in this grout
one after other, each tile being gently tapped with a wooden mallet till it is properly bedded
and in level with adjoining tiles. The joints shall be as close as possible and in straight lines.
The joints between the tiles shall not be greater than 1.5 mm wide. After the day work is over
or after the tiles have been laid in a room, the surplus cement slurry and the joints shall be
cleaned and washed, fairly deep, with a help of a broomstick. The day after the tiles have
been laid, the joints shall be filled with cement slurry of the same shade as the colour of
matrix of the tiles used.
ix) Tiles, which are fixed in the floor adjoining the wall, shall go about 10 mm under the plaster,
skirting or dado. For this, the wall plaster may be left unfinished by about 50 mm above the
level of the proposed finished flooring level. Where the full tile cannot be provided, tiles shall
be out to size and then fixed in a pattern as approved by the Engineer.
Page 67 of 95

x) After fixing, the flooring should be kept moist and allowed to nature undisturbed for seven
days, Heavy traffic shall not be allowed on the floor for at least 14 days after fixing of tiles.
xi) Whenever big areas of floor to be tiled, the level of the central portion of floor shall be kept
10 mm higher than the level marked at the wall unless specified otherwise.
xii) Grinding shall preferably be done using a machine except for skirting. Grinding and polishing
shall be commenced only after 14 days of laying.
xiii) For grinding terrazzo tile flooring, the first grinding shall be with machine fitted with
carborundum stones of 48 to 60 grit. When the floor is rubbed even and chips show
uniformity it shall be cleaned with water making bare all pin holes. Grouting in the same
shade is then briskly applied so that all pinholes are properly filled in. The grout shall be kept
moist for a week for proper setting. Thereafter the second grinding with carborundumof 120
grit shall commence. The floor is grouted again to fill in fine pinholes. After curing the floor
is left with this protective film till other works are completed. Before the final grinding the
floor is swept clean. Final grinding is then done with carborundumof 220 to 350 grit using
plenty of water and taking care that any foreign matter, particles of sand etc. are prevented,
when surface is rendered smooth, it is washed with water. Afterwards oxalic powder is
vigorously applied with machine fitted with Hessian hobs to bring out sheen. Wash the floor
clean and apply dry linen to suck in moisture. Wax polishing shall then be applied as per IS
1443 – latest edition.
xv)

When hand grinding and polishing has to be adopted, the various process in the same
sequence as described in shall be carried out.

xvi) In the case of plain cement and coloured tiles the polishing shall be the same as described in
viii) but the initial grinding with carborundum stone of 48 to 60 grit may not be necessary.
xvii) Where the tiles have been supplied and fixed in rough condition (i.e. not ground and filled
by the tile manufacturer), the first grinding shall commence after 14 days of fixing of tiles
with carborundum stones of 36 to 48 grit. The remaining process shall be same as in viii).
xviii) Tile skirting or dadoing wherever required shall be fixed only after laying the tiles on the
floor. If the tiles are to be fixed on walls as dados, the portion of the wall to be so tiled shall
be loft unplastcrede. Before fixing tiles on brick / concrete surface the surface shall first be
wetted with clean water. Thereafter in case of dado the wall surface shall be evenly and
uniformly covered with about 10 mm thick backing of C.M. one cement and 4 coarse sand.
In the case of skirting, the tiles shall be directly fixed with cement mortar 1:4 without initial
backing. Before the cushioning mortar has hardened the back of each tile to be fixed shall
be covered with a thin layer of neat cement paste and the tile shall gently be tapped against
the wall with a wooden mallet. The3 fixing shall be done from the bottom of the wall
upwards. Each tile shall be fixed as close as possible to the adjoining and difference in the
thickness of the tiles shall be evened out in the cushioning mortar or cement paste so that all
Page 68 of 95

the tile faces are set in conformity with one another. Skirting and dado may be polished by
hand just as for floor work. The proportions for mortar shall be different than specified
above when shown in drawings and /or schedule of quantities.
ix)

Tile flooring shall be measured in square meters correct to two places of decimal while the
individual dimensions shall be measured correct to one centimeter. No deduction shall be
made or extra paid for any opening in the floor area up to 0.1 square meters. Nothing extra
shall be paid for use of cut tiles or for laying the floor at different levels. Tile flooring laid
in floor borders and bands etc., shall be measured in the same item and nothing extra shall
be payable on account of these or similar bands formed of half or multiples of half size
standard tiles or other uncut tiles. Treads of stairs and steps paved with tiles shall also be
measured under terrazzo tile flooring unless otherwise specified.
